Lessons from the history of science:
The Harvard linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902–1950) proposed a phonological “Principle of Frequency”: the ease
with which a word may be pronounced is “inversely proportionate to the relative frequency of that word … among its
fellow words … in the stream of spoken language.” In other words, “as usage becomes more frequent, form becomes … more easily pronounceable.”
He examined this notion in a series of books beginning in 1932. Publishing the last of these the year I was born (1949 —coincidence??), he had by then extended the idea to a general theory of all kinds of human behavior, not just
linguistic behavior, purporting to explain such behavior by reference to a fundamental principle that people tend, when
required to carry out a task, to expend the least possible effort that is consistent with an adequately effective
performance (Zipf, 1949, Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort).
Zipf had started with data on the frequency of occurrence of words supplied by a corpus of 100,000 word-occurrences
in English text (compiled by Godfrey Dewey, son of Melville, creator of the eponymous library classification system).
His analysis (which had additional data including some on Chinese) appeared in a book entitled Selected Studies of
the Principle of Relative Frequency in Language (Zipf, 1932).
One review of that book appeared in 1933, and I’ve excerpted from it in the attached Word document.
Today I give thanks for never having received quite as harsh a review as that.
