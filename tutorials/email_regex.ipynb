    "### Task 1: Extract the email address from the text\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to extract the email address from the text. To do this, we need to create a regular expression pattern that matches the email address. We know that email addresses have the following structure:\n",
    "* They start with a sequence of characters that can be letters, numbers, dots, or underscores.\n",
    "* This sequence is followed by the \"@\" symbol.\n",
    "* After the \"@\" symbol, there is another sequence of characters that can be letters, numbers, dots, or underscores.\n",
    "* This second sequence is followed by the \".\" symbol.\n",
    "* Finally, there is a sequence of letters that represents the domain.\n",
    "* The domain can have one or more parts separated by dots.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we represent this structure using regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with just the sequence of characters before the \"@\" symbol. We can use the pattern `\\w+` to represent a sequence of one or more word characters. The `\\w` pattern matches any word character (including underscores). The `+` symbol indicates that we want to match at least one, but as many as possible of these word characters. Try it... add `\\w+` to the \"REGULAR EXPRESSION\" box and see what it matches...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try it before proceeding... - `\\w+`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that didn't work as expected. The pattern `\\w+` matched all of the words in the text, not just the email address. This happened because the pattern `\\w+` matches any sequence of word characters, not just the email address. We also didn't capture the dot that came before the \"@\" symbol in the email address. Let's tackle the dot first. We can use the pattern `\\.` to match a dot. Try it... add `\\.` to what you already have in the \"REGULAR EXPRESSION\" box and see what it matches...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try it before proceeding... - `\\w+\\.`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that's one step forward and one step back. We now have captured the dot before the \"@\" symbol, but we are still matching all words that have a period after them, and we've lost the email address that doesn't have a period before the \"@\" symbol. We need to make the dot optional. We can do this by using the `?` symbol after the dot. The `?` symbol indicates that the preceding character is optional. Try it... add `?` to what you already have in the \"REGULAR EXPRESSION\" box and see what it matches...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try it before proceeding... - `\\w+\\.?`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This worked, it's now capturing all parts of the email address before the \"@\" symbol. But we have a problem: We're capturing the first part of the email address, but when there's a dot, we're capturing the part after the dot as a *different* match (notice how it's a different color in the matches).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can address this by letting our pattern know that we don't care about the ordering of the word characters and dots, we want to capture all of them regardless of the ordering. We can do this by using square brackets `[]` to create a character set. A character set allows us to specify a set of characters that we want to match. For example, the character set `[abc]` will match any of the characters `a`, `b`, or `c` regardless of which ones appear and in what order. We can use a character set to match any word character or dot. Try it... replace what we have in the \"REGULAR EXPRESSION\" box with `[\\w\\.]+` and see what it matches...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try it before proceeding... - `[\\w\\.]+`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Better! Now we're capturing all parts of the email address before the \"@\" symbol as one match. Let's add in the \"@\" symbol. We can do this by adding `@` to the pattern. Try it... add `@` to what you already have in the \"REGULAR EXPRESSION\" box and see what it matches...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try it before proceeding... - `[\\w\\.]+\\@`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even better! Now we're no longer capturing strings that do not contain an \"@\" symbol - which is good. Now we need to capture the second part of the email address. We can use the same pattern we used for the first part of the email address: `[\\w\\.]+`. Try it... add `[\\w\\.]+` to what you already have in the \"REGULAR EXPRESSION\" box and see what it matches...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try it before proceeding... - `[\\w\\.]+\\@[\\w\\.]+`**\n",
    "\n",
    "We're almost there! But that one non-email-address is still being captured! What makes email addresses systematically different from that string such that we could use a pattern to capture them? The domain part of the email address is a sequence of letters that *must* be followed by a dot and then another sequence of letters. We can use the pattern we started with in reverse to specify that it must end with a dot followed by a sequence of letters. Try it... add `\\.\\w+` to what you already have in the \"REGULAR EXPRESSION\" box and see what it matches...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try it before proceeding... - `[\\w\\.]+\\@[\\w\\.]+\\.\\w+`**\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing, we know that the bit after the last dot is either 2 (e.g., `.uk`) or 3 (e.g., `.com`) characters long. We can specify this by using the `{}` pattern. The `{}` pattern allows us to specify the number of times we want to match a pattern. For example, the pattern `\\w{2,3}` will match a sequence of letters that is at least 2 characters long and at most 3 characters long. Try it... replace `\\w+` with `\\w{2,3}` in the \"REGULAR EXPRESSION\" box and see what it matches...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try it before proceeding... - `[\\w\\.]+\\@[\\w\\.]+\\.\\w{2,3}`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! We've successfully matched the email addresses. We can use this pattern in Python to extract email addresses from text."
