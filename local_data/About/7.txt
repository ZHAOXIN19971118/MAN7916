Help with Advice
Our people have always had real knowledge about hardware and home improvement, and offer practical advice that's not only easy to understand but could save you time and money. We have plenty of printed advice in store as well our MitrePlans and other product tips for you to take home.	
Help with Product
Each of our privately owned stores are committed to carefully selecting the right range of products that provides you with everything you need, and nothing you don't. If there's a specific product you are looking for that's not in stock, our stores will either recommend an alternative product or may be able to order it in for you.
Help with Price
Mitre 10 provides a commitment and guarantee on the merchandise stocked in-store. If a local competitor offers a lower everyday price on an identical in-stock product, your store will beat that price by 10%. This offer is not valid on a sale price, or on a trade purchase.
