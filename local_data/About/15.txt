Established in 1952 with the purchase of a single flour mill, the Manildra Group of companies has since undergone steady growth. The company is now the largest user of wheat for industrial purposes in Australia processing some 1 million tonnes of wheat per annum.

Over the last 50 years Manildra has vertically integrated and as a result diversified the product range to include flour, pre-mixes and products derived from flour such as modified starches, glucose syrups, maltodextrine, gluten, specialty protein products and ethanol.
