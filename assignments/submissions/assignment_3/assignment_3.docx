1. The texts you collected and constructs you selected, and why you chose them.
I collected 25 DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) statements from various company websites. These statements represent a mix of industries, including retail, technology, healthcare, and hospitality. The texts were chosen because they provide a diverse sample of organizational approaches to DEI and allow for meaningful analysis of variance in constructs.
Constructs Selected:
Specificity of Goals: This construct measures how explicitly and clearly the DEI statement articulates specific, measurable goals related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Breadth of DEI Efforts: This construct assesses the range and inclusiveness of the company’s DEI initiatives, evaluating whether the efforts target various stakeholders and dimensions of diversity.
Why These Constructs?
These constructs were chosen to capture two critical aspects of DEI initiatives. Specificity of Goals evaluates the clarity and measurability of DEI objectives, while Breadth of DEI Efforts reflects the inclusiveness and comprehensiveness of an organization’s DEI strategy.

2. The process you followed to develop your codebook and coding form. This section should be reasonably detailed and include:
Steps Followed:

Initial Review of Texts:
Collected 25 DEI statements from company websites.
Conducted an initial reading of the texts to identify recurring themes and patterns.

Defining Constructs:
Defined the constructs (Specificity of Goals and Breadth of DEI Efforts) with clear, operational definitions.
Developed scoring criteria for each construct on a 1-5 scale.

Drafting the Codebook:
Created a codebook that included detailed definitions, scoring guidelines, and examples for each construct.
The scoring guidelines were designed to ensure consistency and clarity for coders.

Developing the Coding Form:
Designed an Excel-based coding form with columns for the text ID, Specificity of Goals score and Breadth of DEI Efforts score.

Coder Recruitment and Training:
Asked a graduate student to be a second coder.
Trained the coder on the codebook and coding form through a 30-minute session, including a review of scoring guidelines and a practice coding session with three sample texts.

Pilot Coding:
Both coders independently scored three sample texts to test the clarity of the codebook and identify discrepancies.
Discussed discrepancies and refined the codebook where necessary.

Full Coding:
Independently coded all 25 texts using the finalized codebook and coding form.

Calculating Interrater Reliability:
Used Krippendorff's alpha to calculate interrater reliability for each construct. Interrater reliability for specificity of goal is 0.864, for the other one is 0.839.

Decisions Made:
Opted for a 1-5 scoring scale for greater granularity and differentiation between texts
I first wanted to use commitment to diversity as the second construct. Later, I decided to replace the initial "Commitment to Diversity" construct with "Breadth of DEI Efforts" to reduce overlap

Challenges Encountered:
Some statements lacked clarity, making it difficult to assess Specificity of Goals. I resesolved by creating clearer distinctions in the scoring guidelines.
Initial pilot coding revealed inconsistencies.I refined the codebook and conducted additional training.


3.Briefly discuss how you would proceed if you were going to continue with the content analysis for a full sample instead of the small sample you used for this assignment.
What Would Be Done Differently:
Collect a larger and more diverse sample of DEI statements across industries and geographies to ensure generalizability.
I will include more variables such as firm size and length of the statements.

What Would Be Done the Same:
Scoring Guidelines: retain the 1-5 scoring system for granularity and differentiation.
Interrater Reliability: Maintain the use of Krippendorff's alpha to ensure robust interrater reliability.

why?
Increasing sample size and refining the codebook would enhance reliability and generalizability. Retaining effective practices, such as scoring guidelines and pilot coding, ensures consistency and rigor in the process.
