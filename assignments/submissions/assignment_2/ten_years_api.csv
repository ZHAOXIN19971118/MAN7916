Specifically, we apply both the theory of basic values and job demands‐resources theory to understand when and why objective value priority congruence with other organizational members results in positive or negative outcomes for both individuals and groups. Using data from a large quick service organization, we examine how employee‐supervisor and employee‐group value priority congruence and incongruence, on social or personal values, relate to both affective and behavioral individual‐level outcomes (employee engagement and turnover), and group‐level outcomes (collective engagement, customer satisfaction, sales, and group turnover). The results suggest that value priority congruence is associated with less employee engagement and higher turnover when the shared values represent personal (rather than social) value priorities because personal values are misaligned with the demands of the job. In some instances incongruence results in more positive outcomes than congruence on personal values. This pattern of results is consistent across both employee‐supervisor and employee‐group foci. Further, groups in which members predominantly prioritize personal values have lower collective engagement; resulting in significantly lower customer satisfaction and lower sales compared to groups with a majority of members who prioritize values aligned with job demands (social values). Altogether, this research helps explain when value congruence will be positive, and why value incongruence can be more beneficial than value congruence in some instances.</jats:p>",2025

Yet little is known about how those who are the recipients of venting react affectively and behaviorally to this experience at work. To advance our understanding of venting receipt in the workplace, we integrate the archaic view of vicarious emotions into research related to venting at work to develop theory regarding how receiving venting is likely to evoke feelings of personal distress and empathy as employees react to and process this social information. In turn, we theorize that while personal distress leads to venting enactment, empathy leads to helping that can promote more positive social relations, highlighting the double‐edged nature of this phenomenon. Finally, beyond clarifying the theoretical ways that venting recipients react, we also consider how the broader social context—namely, coworker similarity—has the potential to shape these reactions. Across two within‐person field studies, both of which utilize a newly developed measure of venting receipt at work, and a supplemental recall experiment, our research highlights why and when venting at work can have divergent effects on venting recipients.</jats:p>",2024

10.1111/peps.12669,Inclusion Management Practices as a Pathway to Enhance Organizational Resilience in Response to a Crisis: An Empirical Test in the Context of the COVID‐19 Pandemic,184,6,0,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12669,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Organizations inevitably face various forms of disruptive events (e.g., external crises), and sustaining long‐term prosperity requires them to stay resilient when encountering unexpected adversity. Prior crisis management research predominantly relied on qualitative case studies to examine efforts after a crisis had occurred, treating the crisis as a “given” rather than a variable. The exceptionality of crisis situations and the ad hoc nature of crisis countermeasures largely limit current knowledge about how organizations may manage employees to remain in a preparative stance for disruptive events. Integrating the inclusion literature, crisis management research, and event system theory, we propose inclusion management practices as a viable pathway for organizations to develop resilience resources and capabilities prior to a crisis, allowing them to exhibit greater robustness and agility when a crisis arises. Such robustness and agility, in turn, enhance organizational performance thereafter. We further pinpoint the strength of a crisis event as an important contingency shaping the effects of pre‐crisis inclusion management practices on organizations’ resilient responses and thereby performance. We tested our hypotheses in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic crisis using longitudinal manager‐report survey data (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 884 workplaces). We found that workplaces that implemented more inclusion management practices before COVID‐19 were more robust and agile in response to the pandemic crisis. Agility (but not robustness), in turn, was positively related to organizational performance. In addition, the effect of inclusion management practices on agility was stronger for workplaces with greater COVID‐19 event strength.</jats:p>",2024

This study examines the proximal experiences of trait‐incongruent work demands among highly introverted individuals, offering a novel episodic and trait‐specific perspective on workplace misfit. Through narrative surveys and semi‐structured interviews, we identify four broad trait‐incongruent work demands that spur episodic misfit at work for introverts. We introduce an integrated process model that reveals how individuals’ reactions to introversion‐incongruent work demands evolve in the time proximal to the work demand. We build theory about (1) how individuals navigate and cope with introversion‐incongruent work demands before, during, and after they occur (and how these adaptations affect immediate and subsequent reactions); (2) why reactions of individuals are sometimes amplified or attenuated across various experiences of trait‐incongruent work demands; and (3) how subsequent exposure to these work demands (i.e., experience) plays a role in repeating this cycle. We offer new insights into how and why individual reactions to episodic misfit evolve before, during, and after a specific situation, and factors that may moderate these reactions—a topic that has received scant attention in the person‐environment fit literature. We provide propositions for future research and practice‐related implications.</jats:p>",2024

We propose and test a conceptual model suggesting employee work stress will negatively affect supervisory career and psychosocial mentoring support. Drawing from social exchange theory, we predict this will indirectly affect employee career success (lower career satisfaction and promotability ratings, fewer promotions), and that the relationship between employee work stress and lower supervisory mentoring support can be explained by lower levels of work engagement experienced by, and attributed to, stressed employees. We tested our model across three studies. In Study 1, we collected four waves of multisource field data (254 employees, 127 managers, and company records) at a large postal organization in the United Kingdom (UK). Employee work stress was negatively related to supervisor career and psychosocial mentoring support, and indirectly affected career satisfaction and manager promotability ratings of employees via supervisor career mentoring support. Cross‐lagged panel analyses in a supplemental study additionally supported the proposed directionality of relationships. Study 2 included data across three waves from employees in Hong Kong (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 137) and showed that employee work stress had indirect effects on supervisor career and psychosocial mentoring via lower employee engagement. In Study 3, using data from supervisors in the UK (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 240) we showed that supervisor perceived employee stress had indirect effects on their provision of supervisor career and psychosocial mentoring support via lower perceived employee engagement.</jats:p>",2024

To date, most studies on the implications of voluntary turnover rate have been conducted at the between‐organization level, comparing organizations with varying levels of voluntary turnover rates. Building upon complex adaptive system (CAS) theory, we develop within‐organization theorizing regarding the implications of voluntary turnover rate fluctuations for organizational innovation. We propose a U‐shape threshold model, where the relationship between voluntary turnover rate fluctuations and innovation takes a negative form when voluntary turnover rate fluctuations are within the normal range for an organization, and a positive form when voluntary turnover rate fluctuations surpass a critical threshold reflecting far‐from‐equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, we investigate how organizations may utilize human resource (HR) practices to shift the critical threshold. Specifically, we argue that increased reliance on interaction‐facilitating HR practices (employee participation and group‐based pay) lowers the threshold, while increased reliance on interaction‐inhibiting HR practices (individual‐based pay) raises the threshold. With firm‐fixed effects modeling, we found general support for our hypotheses using a large‐scale, multi‐level, longitudinal dataset from Statistics Canada (7110 workplace‐year observations from 1980 workplaces). We provide a novel theoretical lens to understand the nature and management of collective turnover.</jats:p>",2024

Yet, we know very little about whether silence in teams (<jats:italic>team silence)</jats:italic> in fact reduces team performance, and if it does, how team silence might be ameliorated. Grounded in social information processing (SIP) theory, we hypothesize and investigate the role of leaders as a potent social informational source to reduce team silence and in turn, enhance team performance. We further posit the role of team commitment to the organization as an important amplifier of humble leadership in reducing team silence. Across a programmatic series of five empirical studies involving experimental, multisource, and multiwave field data, we found support for the negative relationship between leader humility and team silence. Team silence also mediated the relationship between leader humility and team performance in a variety of work contexts. Findings supported that the benefits of leader humility were amplified in teams with higher levels of organizational commitment. Overall, this paper contributes new theoretical and practical insights by identifying leader humility as a preventative antecedent to team silence, with team commitment to the organization as an important qualifier of the impact of humble leadership on teams.</jats:p>",2024

In the present study, we consider the role of leaders’ chronological age in predicting followers’ perceptions of their leadership style. Whereas ample research uncovers relationships between individuals’ age and how these individuals are perceived by others, little is known about how leaders’ chronological age impacts others’ perceptions of their style. Even less is known about how such relationships vary across cultures and industries. We conducted a meta‐analysis (164 unique studies; <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 397,456 observations) to explore these relationships, using the Full‐Range leadership model. We found that leader age was negatively related to perceptions of transformational and transactional leadership, and positively related to perceptions of passive leadership. Further, some of these effects varied on several cultural dimensions: The negative relationship between leader age and transformational leadership was weaker in collectivistic cultures, while the negative relationship with transactional leadership was stronger in high power distance cultures. Industry type also mattered: the relationship between leader age and both transformational and contingent reward leadership styles was amplified in the public sector. Lastly, perceptions of older leaders were more negative when ratings were provided by followers rather than the leaders themselves. Our findings offer both theoretical and practical implications for leading in an increasingly age‐diverse workforce, such as better informing the workforce of present age stereotypes and their imminent effect on organizations.</jats:p>",2024

In a combination of a lab experiment (Study 1) and a multi‐source field study (Study 2), we show that stress bragging has resoundingly negative implications for braggarts as they are evaluated as less competent and less warm by coworkers, reducing their receipt of citizenship behaviors. Additionally, in Study 2, we find that coworkers of stress braggarts also suffer by experiencing higher levels of burnout due to enhanced stress crossover effects. This research on stress bragging integrates and extends the literatures on stress and self‐promotion, while also providing insight into the relational ramifications of this unconventional behavior.</jats:p>",2024

Employees, however, prefer to work remotely because of the flexibility it provides. In light of such competing perspectives, we conducted a meta‐analysis examining remote work intensity's (RWI) effects on employee outcomes. RWI refers to the extensiveness of remote work ranging from one or two days a week to full‐time remote work. We propose a dual pathway model linking RWI to employee outcomes arguing that it has indirect but opposing effects on the same outcomes via two mediators—perceived autonomy and isolation. Findings from a meta‐analysis of RWI's effects based on 108 studies (<jats:italic>k</jats:italic> = 110, <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 45,288) support the dual pathway model. Allaying organizational concerns about remote work, RWI had overall small but beneficial effects on multiple consequential employee outcomes including job satisfaction, organizational commitment, perceived organizational support, supervisor‐rated performance, and turnover intentions. We also conducted a meta‐analysis of the effects of remote work use (RWU), a binary construct taking on two values—remote workers (users) versus office‐based workers (non‐users of remote work). Findings from the RWU meta‐analysis based on 62 studies (<jats:italic>k</jats:italic> = 63, <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 41,904) suggest that remote workers generally have better outcomes than their office‐based colleagues.

In contrast to other such experiences, workload represents a necessary aspect of employment that cannot be alleviated or removed. It also has both aversive and beneficial aspects; research, therefore, has aimed to examine the circumstances under which its negative effects can be alleviated while still maintaining its potential benefits for individuals and organizations. Such efforts, however, have had mixed success. In this paper, we propose a new way forward by examining the extent to which the concordance of individual expectations about daily workload and actually experienced workload is associated with aversive affective responses (with ultimate impacts of the latter for cross‐day functioning). We test these propositions in two daily studies and find that when experienced workload levels do not align with expectations, individuals experience higher levels of anxiety. Importantly, these effects of unexpected workload are overall stronger in magnitude than the effects of high but expected workload; furthermore, they operate through their impact on individuals’ sense of control. These workload patterns are further indirectly associated with next‐day functioning through sense of control and anxiety. Implications for theory and practice are discussed, together with directions for future research.</jats:p>",2024

Results from a combination of three studies—an archival study of Fortune 500 companies (Study 1), a survey study (Study 2), and an experiment (Study 3)—provide support for our hypotheses. When an organization has lower levels of internally‐directed HIHRS, the positive influence of externally‐directed CSR on attraction to an organization diminishes (Study 3) or disappears (Studies 1 and 2).

With a growing population of former entrepreneurs in the workforce, it has become more important than ever to understand whether, when, and which former entrepreneurs may or may not be likely to quit their post‐entrepreneurship employment. We used a sample of nationally representative 20‐year data from Australia to examine how timing of prior entrepreneurial experience relative to a focal wage job relates to voluntary turnover via a serial mediation by entrepreneurial intention and turnover intention. Results showed that employees with entrepreneurial experience in their second most recent job spell were more likely to develop entrepreneurial intention and turnover intention in sequence, which, in turn, increased quitting risk relative to employees without entrepreneurial experience in the same job spell. However, we did not find evidence for such differences between employees with and without entrepreneurial experience in their most recent job spell. Moreover, the serial mediation effect holds among men but not women. These findings highlight the important role of timing in the relationship between of entrepreneurial experience and post‐entrepreneurship employment attitude and behavior.

We examine this issue among ex‐entrepreneurs—individuals who have transitioned from a business owner to a wage employee. Drawing from role identity theory, we develop a model of the consequences of conflict between a lingering entrepreneur identity and a current work role identity. We propose that ex‐entrepreneurs who experience higher levels of identity conflict will be more likely to experience burnout and less likely to engage in boosterism of their employer, and that these relationships are explained by lower levels of perceived professional identity growth (i.e., progressive identity). We further suggest that the negative effect of conflict on progressive identity is exacerbated by nostalgia for one's entrepreneurial past. In a three‐stage field survey of ex‐entrepreneurs and their romantic partners, we found support for these hypotheses using both partner‐rated outcomes and self‐rated outcomes.

These concerns present a puzzle regarding whether alternative communication tactics exist whereby voicers can secure endorsement for improvement‐oriented initiatives without directly challenging their leader. To address this puzzle, we introduce <jats:italic>voice inquiry</jats:italic>—expressing improvement‐oriented suggestions or concerns in the form of a question—as a submissive communication tactic to secure endorsement. Drawing upon dominance complementarity theory, we argue that voice inquiry prompts endorsement because it enhances leader's sense of power.

We conducted three Pilot Studies to unpack the content, motivation, prevalence, and submissive nature of voice inquiry. Building on this foundation, we conducted a multi‐wave field study with 373 employees and 178 leaders in a transportation company (Study 1) and a vignette experiment with 243 full‐time workers (Study 2). Across studies, our research demonstrates voice inquiry as a theoretically driven communication tactic that increases endorsement by activating leader sense of power, particularly among dominant leaders.</jats:p>",2023

We found that new graduate nurses’ professional identification gradually fell during their initial months in professional practice but rose dramatically after the onset of COVID‐19. We also found that sensegiving and moral elevation during the event led to an increase in professional identification. We further theorize an increase in work meaningfulness as the core mechanism for the hypothesized relationships and obtain supporting evidence from one experiment (Study 2) and two quasi‐experiments (Studies 3a and 3b). Our research reveals the significant influence of positive profession‐spotlighting events on both the identity construction and socialization processes and offers practical implications for how to manage such events.</jats:p>",2023

We build on and extend fit research by advancing an important form of fit—organization‐investor (O‐I) fit, which reflects the compatibility between an organization and its investors. We argue that investors tend to be attracted to organizations whose preferences already “fit” their own and, in so doing, provide a relational perspective to the corporate governance literature that often views the relationship between investors and organizational managers as purely transactional. We focus on the fit of one of the most important factors shaping both organizational and investor behavior––temporal preferences. Specifically, we argue that investors are attracted to firms that fit with their temporal preferences and that high O‐I fit leads to better organizational performance. We tested our hypotheses in a longitudinal archival study of S&amp;P 500 firms and supplemented these findings with two experiments. Together, we find strong support for our hypotheses. Our study showcases the critical role of O‐I fit in shaping the makeup of an organization's investors and its subsequent performance, suggesting the value for scholars, managers, and investors to consider the mutual benefits offered by fit in these relationships.</jats:p>",2023

Despite its infiltration into all occupations, loneliness may be especially problematic for those in extreme occupations, such as entrepreneurs, who deal with acute levels of uncertainty, resource constraints, responsibility, and time pressure. Disparate prior findings suggest that entrepreneurs may be especially prone to loneliness, less prone to loneliness, or that they may have unique coping mechanisms that allow them to effectively manage loneliness. This conflicting evidence suggests that we have an incomplete understanding of loneliness within entrepreneurship, specifically, and extreme occupational contexts more generally. Integrating literature on loneliness, well‐being, and entrepreneurship, we conduct a qualitative, inductive study analyzing over 9000 Reddit posts drawn from online entrepreneurship communities where individuals seek and offer advice on how to address entrepreneurial loneliness. In applying appraisal theory to interpret our findings, we discover that whereas some entrepreneurs experience loneliness as threatening and harmful, others experience loneliness as positive or irrelevant, contrary to existing literature that points to loneliness as wholly negative. As such, we uncover several different processes through which entrepreneurs appraise and cope with their loneliness, as well as occupationally unique outcomes for entrepreneurs if loneliness is not coped with effectively. Our findings and emergent theoretical model of the loneliness process in this extreme occupation have important implications for research and practice regarding loneliness, well‐being, and the psychological and mental health of entrepreneurs.</jats:p>",2023

Integrating Wood and colleagues’ (2007) theory of non‐normativity with Amabile's (1983, 1996) componential theory of creativity, we propose that weirdness, as a form of non‐normativity, yields both positive and negative outcomes for entrepreneurs through two distinct pathways. Specifically, the weirdness advantage operates through entrepreneur creativity, whereas the weirdness liability operates through lower entrepreneur competence. Our empirical analyses of non‐normativity suggest that entrepreneur weirdness indeed is a double‐edged sword. Further, we propose that entrepreneur warmth (being friendly and good natured) moderates both weirdness effects, by strengthening the positive effect on entrepreneur creativity and dampening the negative effect on entrepreneur competence. Implications of the advantages and disadvantages of entrepreneur weirdness are discussed.</jats:p>",2023

This combined article presents six such efforts from operational selection systems in actual organizations. The findings show that ML can score narrative information collected from candidates either in writing or orally in response to assessment questions (called constructed response) as accurately and reliably as human judges, but much more efficiently, making such responses more feasible to include in personnel selection and often improving validity with little or no adverse impact. Moreover, algorithms can generalize across assessment questions, and algorithms can be created to predict multiple outcomes simultaneously (e.g., productivity and turnover). ML has even been demonstrated to make job analysis more efficient by determining knowledge and skill requirements based on job descriptions. Collectively, the studies in this article illustrate the likely major impact that ML will have on the practice and science of personnel selection from this point forward.</jats:p>",2023

We focus on the early stages of organizations—the composition of founding teams (FTs) and the evolution of subsequent hiring practices, namely the prominence of finding new employees via founders’ prior employer and educational affiliations. Drawing upon theories of entrepreneurial resource mobilization and attraction–selection–attrition (ASA), we argue that FTs with common professional ties imprint post‐founding hiring routines by making affiliation‐based hiring (ABH) a more prominent practice to select new personnel. We posit that, although ABH fades quickly after founding, using this hiring strategy in the early stages of an organization shapes its trajectory for diversity and contributes to workforce homogenization in several dimensions as new firms mature. Using a mixed‐methods approach combining large‐scale employer–employee linked data from Denmark and in‐depth surveys with founders from the US and UK, we find robust support for our theory and provide novel insights to the hiring processes in entrepreneurial firms. Our work advances our understanding of the enigmatic origins of within‐organization homogeneity progression and offers important contributions to both theory and practice.</jats:p>",2023

Further, we develop and test hypotheses regarding two mediating pathways, a motivation‐based pathway that relies on the felt passion of the entrepreneur and a control capacity‐based pathway that is connected to the entrepreneur's cognitive flexibility. We conducted two studies to validate the effectiveness of our intervention (Studies 1a and 1b) and four studies to test the validity and effectiveness of our experimental materials and measures (Studies A1a, A1b, A1c, and 2a). Our main study investigates the daily antecedents and mechanisms of entrepreneurial action using a within‐individual field experiment with 201 entrepreneurs (1458 daily observations).

Literature reviews have routinely found, however, substantial within‐team variance in referent‐shift consensus measures of team constructs and that team member agreement is often lower than desired. To enhance our understanding of the structure of within‐team variance, using a sample of 20,183 individuals in 4,313 teams, we explored the proportion of variance attributable to different sources (response acquiescence, positivity bias, and rater variance specific to each construct) for five team constructs. We also examined the extent to which within‐team variance changed over time with a subsample of 3,720 individuals in 731 teams. The results indicated that constructs thought to be more observable, including role clarity and monitoring goal progress, appeared to be less prone to idiosyncratic perceiver effects and that the processes were widely experienced by all team members. Conversely, relationship conflict showed higher levels of within‐team variance and team consensus actually decreased over time. These findings indicate that perceptions of relationship conflict are influenced by the individual differences of team members and that conflict may be restricted to dyads or subgroups within teams. Overall, the findings indicate that stable perceiver effects and processes that are limited to a small proportion of team members may have a stronger influence on ratings of some team constructs than previously thought. We conclude with suggestions for theory development, team construct measurement, and advice to understand processes that lead to consensus in perceptions of team constructs.</jats:p>",2023

This article presents three such investigations. The findings show that the growing practice of making statistical adjustments to (nonlinear) ML algorithms to reduce subgroup differences must create predictive bias (differential prediction) as a mathematical certainty. This may reduce validity and inadvertently penalize high‐scoring racial minorities. Similarly, one approach that adjusts the ML input data only slightly reduces the subgroup differences but at the cost of slightly reduced model accuracy. Other emerging tactics involve weighting predictors to balance or find a compromise between the competing goals of reducing subgroup differences while maintaining validity, but they have been limited to two outcomes. The third investigation extends this to three outcomes (e.g., validity, subgroup differences, and cost) and presents an online tool. Collectively, the studies in this article illustrate that ML is unlikely to be able to resolve the issue of adverse impact, but it may assist in finding incremental improvements.</jats:p>",2023

We build on an emerging line of research to explore the mechanisms through which leaders’ personal financial insecurity impacts the teams they lead. We draw on compensatory control theory to theorize that leaders’ personal financial insecurity has a negative indirect effect on adaptive team performance because more insecurity is associated with less perceived personal control, to which leaders respond by implementing a more hierarchical decision‐making authority structure in their teams. Integrating the social identity theory of leadership, we theorize that this effect is stronger when the leaders are more prototypical of their team. Evidence from three multi‐wave, multi‐source field studies including leaders and their teams and an online experiment supports our model. By uncovering how a leader's perceived financial state impacts those they lead, our work adds to the growing bottom‐line case for why organizations should care about supporting their employees’ financial health.</jats:p>",2023

Its theoretical novelty, however, remains underutilized as a means to contribute unique insights to the leadership literature. We draw on servant leadership's moral foundation—utilitarian consequentialism—and social learning theory to identify cognitive mechanisms (follower other‐orientation and cognitive reflection) through which servant leadership affects employee behavior benefiting two stakeholder groups: a community nonprofit organization and the employing organization. Furthermore, we evaluate the degree to which an employee's moral identity internalization acts as a boundary condition of servant leadership's effects. Data were collected from 274 employee‐supervisor dyads across three waves with objective cognitive reflection scores and objective measures of workplace charitable giving and employee performance. Results supported all hypothesized predictions even after accounting for three alternative mediators. In particular, servant leadership had a positive indirect effect on workplace charitable giving through follower other‐orientation; it also had a positive indirect effect on objective follower financial performance through other‐orientation and cognitive reflection. Both indirect effects were significant at low levels of moral identity internalization but not at high levels.

Drawing from shifting standard and status characteristics theories and the literature on occupations, we propose that conscientiousness yields differential rewards for Blacks and Whites because of the incongruence between stereotypes about Black workers and conscientiousness. We further suggest the occupational value of status as an occupational‐level boundary condition that affects the relationships between conscientiousness, race, and pay. We first tested our model with a large national panel dataset, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 97 (NLSY97), and occupational characteristics scores in the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), finding that the positive effects of conscientiousness on pay were greater for Whites compared to Blacks and that such pay inequality is more pronounced in occupations with high‐status values than in those with low‐status values. A follow‐up experimental study that recruited 202 managers working in the U.S. produced similar results, suggesting that our findings were not attributable to the levels of job performance. Thus, our research demonstrates the role of conscientiousness in generating pay differentials based on race and sheds light on the importance of considering a discrete occupational context that contributes to organizational inequality.</jats:p>",2023

In total, scores from 1.2 billion validation study participants were simulated to describe outcomes across 31,752 combinations selection system design and scoring decisions. The most consistently valuable improvement from adopting MML over traditional regression was from dropping predictors rather than by improving prediction. On average, MML improved prediction of performance from psychometric scale composites only when the ratio of sample size to scale count was less than approximately 3, although algorithm choice, predictor count, and selection ratio affected outcomes as well. We also simulated the effects of design choices when combining item scores, which showed consistent, superior predictive accuracy for several MML algorithms, especially elastic net and random forest, over traditional regression. Given these results, we suggest the potential of machine learning for employee selection is unlikely to be realized in selection systems focusing on the combination of scale composites from previously validated psychometric tests. Instead, it will be realized in unconventional design scenarios, such as the use of individual items to make multiple trait inferences, or with novel data formats like text, image, audio, video, and behavioral traces.

Specifically, whereas highly hazardous work environments are strong situations in which there is a clear need for a high degree of safety behavior, the amount of safety behavior needed to minimize accidents within moderately hazardous environments is more ambiguous. Drawing on self‐regulatory theories of work motivation, we argue that most individuals tend to exhibit a proportional response to hazardousness, such that moderately hazardous environments are met with a moderate degree of safety behavior. However, we demonstrate that proportional responses to hazardousness will ultimately yield an inverted‐U relationship between hazardousness and accidents. Instead, a sharp, non‐linear increase in safety behavior is needed to keep accidents at a low and constant level as hazardousness increases. We present four studies to test our hypotheses. Studies 1 and 2 used archival data to test our hypothesis of an inverted‐U relationship between hazardousness and accidents in natural work settings. Studies 3 and 4 were experiments which replicated this finding, and more importantly, demonstrated that the inverted‐U relationship between hazardousness and accidents was driven by a failure to sharply increase safety behavior in response to small increases in hazardousness. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for the safety literature, particularly the need to educate workers regarding the pattern of safety behavior needed to fully offset environmental hazardousness.</jats:p>",2023

We test our theoretical model in two experience sampling studies that track employees’ physical activity across 10 workdays, using multiple data sources (self, supervisor, and objective). Findings across two studies consistently reveal that autonomous motivation prompts employees’ average levels of daily physical activity, which, on a daily basis, generates resource caravans—physical (sleep quality), affective (vigor), and cognitive (task focus)—that, in turn, variously benefit next‐day performance (task and creative performance) and health (somatic symptoms). Next‐day task performance is enhanced through increased task focus, while next‐day somatic symptoms are reduced through improved sleep quality and vigor.

Specifically, we argue that maternity benefits can signal how pregnant workers are treated within the organization, particularly as women compare their own benefits to referent others'. Drawing from identity threat response theory, we propose a conceptual framework that explains the influence of maternity benefit comparisons on perceptions of discrimination and, subsequently, turnover. Upon evaluating two studies using multi‐wave survey data and two vignette studies, our results indicate that when women perceive their maternity benefits to be less favorable than referent others' benefits, they perceive more pregnancy discrimination. In turn, perceptions of pregnancy discrimination influence their subsequent turnover decisions. Consistent with identity threat response theory, our results also suggest that perceived supervisor support is a significant moderator, weakening the impact of maternity benefit comparisons on perceptions of pregnancy discrimination.</jats:p>",2023

Their communications, decisions, and behaviors influence employees to act ethically or unethically to accomplish organizational goals. To be sure, various reviews within the behavioral ethics literature have highlighted the crucial role that ethical leadership plays in gearing organizations and employees ethically. Yet, numerous documented ethical failings in organizations have evidenced the impact of unethical leadership—where leaders’ unethical conduct or influence on employees promotes unethicality within organizations and generates harmful consequences. Therefore, understanding the darker side of leadership is important. The literature that has emerged in the organizational sciences on the study of unethical leadership, however, is fragmented, creating ambiguities and introducing potential confounds on what constitutes unethical leadership. We review this body of work, summarizing findings on the antecedents, explanatory mechanisms, and consequences of unethical leadership. We then provide an evaluation of the unethical leadership conceptualization, taking stock of previous conceptualizations, problems associated with past approaches, and offer considerations for a conceptualization to progress future scholarship. The goal is to engage scholarly conversation on how to evolve the unethical leadership domain without engaging in logical fallacy or post‐hoc rationalization. We offer practical implications for managers to address and minimize unethical leadership within their organizations and outline future research directions to advance our understanding of unethical leadership and its nomological network.</jats:p>",2023

However, the organizational literature has been hampered by a significant shortcoming in considering it solely as an objective construct, despite research in other disciplines demonstrating a critical subjective component to how body fatness is experienced. To address this conceptual and theoretical challenge, we draw on stigma theory to explore the workplace implications of subjective fatness, or how big one feels in their own mind. We utilize and extend stigma theory by integrating it with medical research. In doing so, we shed new light on the subjective nature of the self‐devaluation process that occurs in stigmatized individuals. We argue that this self‐devaluation process is the mechanism by which subjective body fatness influences work performance. We test these hypotheses across three studies that constructively replicate results across multiple design types (multi‐rater, time‐lagged, &amp; bivariate latent‐change model) and diverse geographic samples. Results consistently show that subjective fatness exerts a stronger impact on performance than objective fatness, and this influence is mediated by self‐devaluation. In all, our work indicates it is not how big one is but how big one feels that most affects work performance.</jats:p>",2023

In this study, we integrate ambivalent sexism theory with self‐regulation theory to explore the differential impact of experiences of hostile (i.e., overt, derogatory, expressions of female inferiority) and benevolent sexism (i.e., subtle, seemingly positive, expressions of female incompetence) during the job search. Further, drawing from research on discrimination, we also consider whether reactions to sexism are shaped by the extent to which women identify with their gender. We tested our conceptual model through a weekly study of 103 female new labor market entrants. Findings indicated that while weekly experiences of hostile sexism related to heightened anger, experiences of benevolent sexism elicited anxiety; these effects were exacerbated for highly gender‐identified female job seekers. Anxiety—but not anger—prompted next‐week job search effort and intensity, which yielded distinct effects on search success and well‐being. Notably, exploratory analyses demonstrated that these affective responses to weekly experiences of hostile and benevolent sexism did not emerge for male job seekers, suggesting that such experiences of sexism can be more impactful for women on the job market. Thus, our work highlights the critical self‐regulatory processes that unfold weekly following female job seekers’ exposure to sexism.</jats:p>",2023

Specifically, we propose that the positive effect of LMXD on team performance is due to its impact on team role clarity, whereas the negative effects operate through team relationship conflict. To shed light on the boundary conditions that qualify the divergent mechanisms, we further examine the moderating roles of three team structural characteristics (also referred to as team type dimensions), including authority differentiation (AD), skill differentiation (SD), and temporal stability (TS). We conducted two studies to examine our model, which involve multi‐source and multi‐phase lagged data from multiple organizations from diverse industries. Across the two studies, we find consistent support for the coordination‐enabling mechanism and the roles of AD and SD in qualifying this mechanism. Regarding the conflict‐enabling mechanism, both studies support the moderating effect of SD. In contrast, we find limited support for the moderating effect of TS on both the coordination‐enabling and conflict‐enabling mechanisms, although we were only able to examine this in Study 2.

Findings from three experience sampling studies show that negative gossip about the supervisor is a double‐edged sword for gossipers that seems to do more harm than good to their work engagement. On the one hand, spreading negative gossip about the supervisor evokes the resource‐consuming mechanism of image maintenance concerns, which impairs gossipers’ work engagement, especially when perceived organizational politics is higher. On the other hand, engaging in such gossip elicits the resource‐generating mechanism of sense of power, which only improves work engagement in Study 3 but not in Studies 1 and 2; contrary to our expectation, this effect is unaffected by perceived organizational politics.

Yet, when considering its impact, scholars tend to focus on the overall amount of unethical behavior and neglect how it is distributed within the team. We propose that considering the way unethical behavior is patterned within teams provides a new lens by which to uncover when unethical behavior has less of a harmful impact. Integrating typologies of team configurations with social impact theory, we theorize that the impact of cheating on relationship conflict and creative performance depends on the interaction between how it is configured (i.e., the amount and pattern of individual member cheating behavior) and levels of peer‐based rational control. In a diverse sample of almost one hundred teams, we find that relative to teams with a fragmented cheating configuration, teams with a bad apple cheating configuration experience less relationship conflict in contexts with high peer‐based rational control; an effect that subsequently impacts team creative performance. Our research demonstrates the value added by considering how cheating emerges as different team configurations and offers implications for interventions intended to suppress its harmful effects.</jats:p>",2023

The suggested approach is demonstrated by using three machine learning methods (elastic net, random forest, and gradient boosting) along with publicly available O*NET data to predict annual nonfatal occupational incident rates published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Findings indicate that O*NET descriptors from several subdomains including abilities, work context, and work activities were significant in predicting occupational injury rates. The amount of variance explained by the predictors varied from 54.2% (gradient boosting) to 58.8% (elastic net) with 12 common predictors across the three methods.

Ultimately, these proximal reactions will increase the receiver's helping behavior toward the sender. We tested our model with a 15‐day experience sampling study (Study 1) and an experiment (Study 2). Results showed that gossip truthfulness had a positive effect on the receiver's perception of the social exchange relationship, leading the receiver to provide more helping behavior to the sender. Gossip interestingness had a positive effect on the receiver's state happiness, leading to increased helping behavior toward the sender. Gossip interestingness also had a serial indirect effect on helping behavior, via increased state happiness that increased receiver social exchange perceptions.

The comparison of those anticipated ratings along with employee's current job satisfaction creates two operationalizations: <jats:italic>the quantity of more desirable job alternatives</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>the quality (or extent of desirability) of job alternatives</jats:italic>.

Second, both the quantity and the quality of more desirable job alternatives compared to the current job positively correlated with employees’ future turnover behavior.

We further propose openness to experience as a moderator of the countervailing mechanisms, such that the positive path through risk‐taking is stronger and the negative path through perspective taking is weaker for individuals with higher (vs. lower) levels of openness. We test our hypotheses with three multisource and multi‐wave field studies (Study 1: <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 181 part‐time MBAs paired with peers; Study 2: <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 128 sales employees paired with store managers; Study 3: <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 153 sales employees paired with store managers). The results support our theoretical model, showing that sense of power and creativity are simultaneously connected positively through risk‐taking and negatively through perspective taking, and that the overall indirect effect of sense of power on creativity is more positive for individuals with higher (vs. lower) levels of openness to experience.</jats:p>",2022

In this research, we argue that its paradoxical effects can be disentangled by the presence of two distinct types of leader narcissism—narcissistic admiration and narcissistic rivalry—which can shape leaders’ initial relationship‐building with new followers (i.e., newcomers) differently. Integrating a dual‐type view of narcissism with leader–member exchange (LMX) theory and conducting a multi‐wave, multi‐source field study with 151 leader‐newcomer dyads, we found that leader narcissistic admiration is negatively related to leader perceived threat of a newcomer whereas leader narcissistic rivalry is positively related to it. Leader perceived threat of a newcomer, in turn, reduces the newcomer's LMX perceptions and ultimately hinders the newcomer's job satisfaction and task performance. Moreover, leader perceived similarity with a newcomer was found to strengthen the negative (positive) effect of leader narcissistic admiration (rivalry) on leader perceived threat of a newcomer. We did not find support for the moderation effect of newcomer acceptance seeking from the leader. This research sheds light on the value of adopting a content‐specific and multidimensional approach in studying leader narcissism.</jats:p>",2022

We propose that an important way that they can do so is by engaging in behaviors we refer to as “Managing Your Boss” (MYB) that involve employees taking the initiative to understand their managers’ goals, needs, and working styles and adapt their job priorities and actions accordingly. We integrate theories on proactivity and followership to lay the conceptual foundation for the study of MYB. We underscore the conceptual distinctiveness of MYB from related constructs. Moreover, we propose that MYB can help employees improve their performance by enabling them to develop high quality leader‐member exchanges (LMX) and argue that these effects are amplified in unstructured work environments where jobs are not standardized or when managers fail to provide adequate task structure. Using 1313 working adults across a set of four studies and seven samples, we develop a validated measure of MYB, establish its nomological network, and demonstrate support for key elements of our theoretical model.

By pairing two studies, using mixed‐methods, and drawing on conservation of resources theory, we contribute new and previously unavailable information about three questions. How and to what extent does going through a divorce affect individuals at work? What factors differentiate a lower versus higher impact on work? Do work outcomes improve after a divorce has been completed? In Study 1, individuals currently in the process of divorcing report more negative mood at work, lower job performance, and lower health in comparison to employees recently divorced, divorced over 5 years ago, or never divorced. Qualitative findings illustrate vivid reports of intrusive negative affect and reduced focus at work. At the same time, nearly 39% of individuals reported that divorcing had a positive impact on their job, work, or career. Qualitative findings reveal that for some, divorcing frees up time and energy and amplifies motivation for work. Study 2 is a longitudinal survey study of individuals in the process of a divorce. Findings indicate that levels of divorce‐related grief, quality of the dissolving marriage, the presence of children, and anticipated post‐divorce financial stability differentiate between those with better and worse work outcomes. Individuals improve on work‐related cognitive and physical engagement, job performance, and health after their divorces are completed. Our results extend empirical knowledge and theory with new insights about work outcomes associated with divorcing as well as the recovery of work outcomes over time.</jats:p>",2022

However, recent research suggests that ideological contract breach, a unique form of contract breach, may yield constructive behaviors because it is not organizations’ direct personal mistreatment of employees, but organizations’ abandonment of a valued cause to benefit a third party. Such an interesting prediction goes beyond the dominant social‐exchange framework, which mainly forecasts destructive responses to breach. In this research, we develop a novel self‐affirmation model to explain how ideological contract breach results in counterintuitive positive outcomes. In a hospital field study among medical professionals (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 362) and their supervisors (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 129), we found that ideological contract breach induces employees’ rumination about the breach, which in turn prompts them to self‐affirm core values at work.

Transformer‐based deep neural networks offer state‐of‐the‐art performance on various natural language tasks. This project adapts the transformer model GPT‐2 to learn the structure of personality items, and generate the largest openly available pool of personality items, consisting of one million new items. We then use that artificial intelligence‐based item pool (AI‐IP) to provide a subset of potential scale items for measuring a desired construct. To better recommend construct‐related items, we train a paired neural network‐based classification BERT model to predict the observed correlation between personality items using only their text. We also demonstrate how zero‐shot models can help balance desired content domains within the scale. In combination with the AI‐IP, these models narrow the large item pool to items most correlated with a set of initial items. We demonstrate the ability of this multimodel framework to develop longer cohesive scales from a small set of construct‐relevant items. We found reliability, validity, and fit equivalent for AI‐assisted scales compared to scales developed and optimized by traditional methods. By leveraging neural networks’ ability to generate text relevant to a given topic and infer semantic similarity, this project demonstrates how to support creative and open‐ended elements of the scale development process to increase the likelihood of one's initial scale being valid, and minimize the need to modify and revalidate the scale.</jats:p>",2022

Previous research suggests that how others respond can be an important determinant of the sharer's affective and well‐being outcomes. However, less is known about whether and how cues embedded in the content of what is shared can shape the type of responses that one receives from others, obscuring the joint and interactive role that both the sharer and listener may play in influencing the sharer's outcomes. In this study, we develop theory to advance our understanding of online coping with an explicitly social focus using computational grounded theorizing and machine learning (ML) techniques applied to a large corpus of work‐related conversations on Reddit. Specifically, our theoretical model sheds light on the dynamics of the online social coping process related to the domain of work. We show that how sharers and listeners interact and react to one another depends on the content of stressors shared, the social coping behaviors used when sharing, and whether the sharer and listener belong to the same occupational context. We contribute to the social coping literature in three ways. First, we clarify how social actors respond to cues embedded in the social coping attempt. Second, we examine the moderating role that such responses play in shaping sharer outcomes. Finally, we extend theory on social coping with work‐related stressors to the online domain. Taken together, this research highlights the importance of the dynamic interplay between sharer and listener in the context of online social coping.</jats:p>",2022

Veterans are often directed to social media platforms to seek support during their transition to civilian life. However, social media platforms are increasingly used to aid in hiring decisions, and these platforms may make veterans’ PTSD more discoverable during the hiring process. Based on social identity theory and identity management theory, the integrated suspicion model, and the stigma literature, we conducted four studies that examine veterans’ PTSD disclosures on social media and the consequences in the hiring process. Study 1 suggests that 16%–34% of veterans included cues related to PTSD status on social media. Study 2, based on 290 upper‐level business students, shows that veterans with PTSD were more stigmatized than veterans without PTSD, and stigmatization is associated with more suspicion and lower hiring‐related ratings (of expected task performance, expected organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB), expected counterproductive work behaviors (CWB), and intention to interview). Study 3, based on 431 working professionals with hiring experience, further supports relationships from Study 2. Study 4, based on 298 working professionals, identifies peril (i.e., perceptions regarding danger) as an additional mediator for the effects of PTSD on hiring‐related ratings. In sum, we identify and explore the identity management conundrum that social media disclosure poses for veterans with PTSD in the hiring process and discuss potential remedies and avenues for future research.</jats:p>",2022

A recent meta‐analysis indicated that interest inventories have substantial validity for predicting career choices. However, traditional approaches to interest inventory scoring (e.g., profile matching) typically capture broad, or average relations between vocational interests and occupations in the population, yet may not be accurate in capturing the specific relations in a given sample. Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a potential way forward as they can effectively take into account complexities in the relation between interests and career choices. Thus, this study aims to enhance the accuracy of interest inventory‐based career choice prediction through the application of ML. Using a large sample (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 81,267) of employed and unemployed participants, we compared the prediction accuracy of a traditional interest profile method (profile matching) to a new machine‐learning augmented method in predicting occupational membership (for employed participants) and vocational aspirations (for unemployed participants). Results suggest that, compared to the traditional profile method, the machine‐learning augmented method resulted in higher overall accuracy for predicting both types of career choices. The machine‐learning augmented method was especially predictive of job categories with high base rates, yet underpredicted job categories with low base rates. These findings have practical implications for improving the utility of interest inventories for organizational practice, contributing to areas such as employee development, recruitment, job placement, and retention.</jats:p>",2022

Drawing from the models of compassion and mind perception theories, we first develop a theoretical model pertaining to the development of compassion as a result of human‐animal work. In a study with zookeepers (Study 1), we find that human‐animal work evokes the emotion of compassion, which in turn is positively associated with employee prosocial behavior and task performance. These mediated effects are moderated by how employees perceive animals—employees are more likely to experience compassion, and in turn, become more prosocial and work better when they generally perceive animals to be able to experience emotions and bodily sensations. Furthermore, two follow‐up studies (i.e., Studies 2 and 3) with employees who engage in human‐animal work in Hong Kong and the United States reveal that working with animals evokes awe in addition to compassion, and provides insight into their resultant impact on prosocial behavior and task performance.

In this systematic and meta‐analytic investigation, using data from 154 articles (168 independent samples), we classify a broad set of dispositions into a previously validated two‐factor dispositional model. This model distinguishes between two dispositional factors that shed light on individuals’ adaptation to change: positive self‐concept and risk tolerance. Drawing from trait activation theory (TAT), we examine the magnitude of effects between each dispositional factor and various groups of outcomes: explicit change responses (e.g., resistance), well‐being (e.g., stress), work attitudes (e.g., job satisfaction), and work behaviors (e.g., job performance). We also evaluate the moderating effects of the change context (its stage, dimensions, and types), national context (cultural dimensions), and study design. To this end, we conducted multi‐level meta‐analyses using samples of employees who experienced organizational change. Our findings support the notion that during organizational change, positive self‐concept and risk tolerance are valid predictors across outcome categories and demonstrate that positive self‐concept is more strongly associated with several employees’ change responses and work attitudes than risk tolerance. These associations vary depending on the type of outcome, the stage of change, the national cultural dimension, and the study design, and to a lesser degree, the dimension and type of change.

Using a large dataset tracking graduates from their last semester in college to up to approximately 1.5 years after graduation and with alcohol use as our empirical referent, we demonstrated that a pattern of high‐risk drinking behavior may remain even after the transition into full‐time employment. We further showed that lower levels of perceived cohort drinking norms and higher levels of mentoring were associated with a higher probability of maturing out, manifesting in a transition from a high‐risk drinking profile before graduation to a moderate drinking profile after starting full‐time employment. Finally, we found that maturing out was associated with lagged outcomes including lower levels of sleep problems and depression and fewer workdays lost to absenteeism, thus underscoring the consequential nature of behavior profile shifts during the C2W transition.</jats:p>",2022

Drawing from work role transitions research on role identity and integrating it with social identity theory, we investigate this line of reasoning by conducting two studies, one field and one online panel study, focusing on blended MTMs, in which employees are concurrently assigned to a permanent team and several temporary project teams. Specifically, we examine the theoretical mechanisms explaining a positive relationship between number of temporary teams and turnover decisions. In Study 1, we surprisingly found that number of temporary teams negatively related to turnover decisions through MTM identity strain with permanent team identification strengthening this effect. In contrast, in Study 2, we found support for the hypothesized relationships: number of teams indirectly positively related to turnover intentions, mediated by MTM identity strain and cognitive depletion, and permanent team identification weakened the indirect effect. We provide explanations for these mixed findings and suggest theoretical and practical implications for MTM research.</jats:p>",2022

This is surprising because a better understanding of assessees’ behaviors may provide the missing link between research on the determinants of assessee performance and research on the validity of performance ratings. Therefore, this study draws on behavioral personality science to scrutinize the behaviors that assessees express in interpersonal AC exercises. Our goals were to investigate (a) the structure of interpersonal behaviors, (b) the consistency of these behaviors across AC exercises, and (c) their effectiveness. We obtained videotaped performances of 203 assessees who took part in AC role‐plays in a high‐stakes context. Apart from assessors’ performance ratings, trained experts also independently coded assessees on over 40 specific behavioral cues in these role‐plays (e.g., clear statements, upright posture, freezing). Results were threefold: First, the structure underlying behavioral differences in interpersonal AC exercises was represented by four broad behavioral constructs: agency, communion, interpersonal calmness, and intellectual competence. Second, assessees’ behaviors showed more consistency across exercises than performance ratings did. Third, the behaviors were related to role‐play performance and predicted future interpersonal performance. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this study's granular, behavior‐driven perspective.</jats:p>",2022

Relying on the Appraisal‐Tendency Framework of emotion, this paper examines the effect of team hopelessness on team performance, as well as its underlying mechanism, collective efficacy. It also explores how leaders’ use of two different interpersonal emotion management (IEM) strategies can moderate this relationship. Across two field studies involving 80 and 170 workplace teams, respectively, we consistently find that team hopelessness negatively impacts team performance through reduced collective efficacy. Moreover, leaders’ use of a problem‐focused IEM strategy weakens the negative relationship between team hopelessness and team performance via collective efficacy, while their use of an emotion‐focused IEM strategy strengthens it. Our research highlights the detrimental effect of team hopelessness on team functioning and the various consequences of different leader IEM strategies.</jats:p>",2022

Results from a preregistered experimental study with 247 participants and an experience sampling study with time‐lagged reports from 79 leaders and 145 members show that a positively imbalanced exchange increases members’ subsequent leader‐directed helping via gratitude (but not via shame) and that a negatively imbalanced exchange increases members’ subsequent risk‐taking via pride (but not via anger). Moreover, the intensity of such effects hinges upon the average level of resource contributions of leader–member dyads.

We provide a new theoretical perspective to age diversity and turnover research, arguing that age separation may not only increase turnover through perceived age discrimination (i.e., a self‐categorization perspective), but can also reduce it through increased perceived belongingness (i.e., a social identity perspective). Following the idea of asymmetric diversity effects, we propose the workforce's average age as a crucial moderator. A longitudinal sample of 2,393 Belgian organizations (2012–2015) reveals that firm‐level age separation stimulates firm‐level collective voluntary turnover, but only in firms with an older average age (Study 1). Data from a representative sample of 4,764 employees from six European countries are consistent with the idea that perceived age separation stimulates aging workers’ turnover intention through increased perceived discrimination and reduced belongingness, and reduces younger workers’ turnover intention through increased belongingness (Study 2). These findings support that age diversity conceptualized as separation is not as unmistakably detrimental for turnover as previously assumed and affects younger and older employees and workforces differently. From a practical perspective, understanding the role of age in the age separation–turnover relationship may help organizations to prevent the loss of valuable knowledge through the departure of both older and younger employees.</jats:p>",2022

Drawing from integrated self‐control theory (ISCT) and theory on self‐compassion, we suggest that on days when employees hold a work self‐compassionate mindset, they will exhibit greater work performance and wellbeing via enhanced resource capacity and motivation. In an experimental experience sampling study, we found that a work self‐compassionate mindset reduced depletion and increased work self‐esteem and thereby heightened daily work engagement and daily resilience. Consequently, employees made greater goal progress at work and experienced higher meaning in life. In a supplemental study, we show that state self‐compassion at work is associated with unique variance in work outcomes beyond compassion received from coworkers.

We used random‐effects meta‐analysis to cumulate the correlations between different features of team design and team creativity or team innovation from 134 field studies representing 11,353 teams and 35 studies representing 2,485 student teams. We found that team tenure is curvilinearly related, autonomy‐supportive leadership, task interdependence, and goal interdependence are positively related, and demographic diversity and team size are unrelated to team creativity and innovation. Examining meta‐analytic path models, we found that task interdependence and supportive leadership positively relate to team creativity and innovation via team collaboration and team potency. In accounting for the literature, we found a dearth of studies examining team processes, some types of diversity such as racial diversity, and the role of team member turnover.

However, the relationship between age and sickness absence is not well understood, as research has yielded mixed findings and has neglected broader societal factors that cascade to shape the age‐sickness absence relationship. To advance the literature, we adopted a resource‐based perspective and investigated the relationship between employee age and sickness absence as mediated by two countervailing mechanisms: physical health issues and work engagement. We also highlighted two country‐level boundary conditions (health expenditure per capita and labor force participation rate) for these mechanisms. We tested our hypotheses with two archival datasets. In Study 1, using a sample of 28,553 employees from 35 European countries, we tested a multilevel model and found that age was positively related to the number of physical health issues, which in turn was positively associated with sickness absence. Country‐level health expenditure per capita was found to mitigate this relationship. We also found that age was positively related to work engagement, which was negatively related to sickness absence, and country‐level labor force participation rate strengthened this relationship. In Study 2, using a multi‐wave dataset (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 304) from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the United States, we found further support for the two hypothesized mechanisms (physical health issues and work engagement) between age and sickness absence.

We push this research in a new direction, drawing on institutional theory and strategic human resource management to identify workplace contextual factors that influence individuals’ propensity to name sexual harassment. Surveying 408 employed adults, we find that current employment in an industry with a high prevalence of sexual harassment reduces individuals’ likelihood of identifying scenarios as sexual harassment. Further, prior work experience in highly sexually harassing industries has a lasting negative effect on individuals’ propensity to name. In contrast, we show that individuals’ propensity to identify sexual harassment is greater when they perceive that their organization has implemented more HR practices supporting a climate for naming and that these HR practices can actually reduce the negative effect of current employment in a highly sexually harassing industry. Critically, by demonstrating that changing industry norms or adopting specific HR practices can shift individual naming of sexual harassment, we offer new avenues for sexual harassment prevention.</jats:p>",2022

Across three field studies, our model is supported as we find that performance is positively related to WSSW, which magnifies the negative effects of abusive supervision on satisfaction. Consequently, we discover that as job performance (and in turn self worth) increases, abusive supervision indirectly reduces job embeddedness and increases turnover through two forms of satisfaction.

We find that task structure is a boundary condition for CI in that groups exhibit CI across well‐structured tasks but not across ill‐structured tasks. For ill‐structured tasks, CI has a more nuanced set of multiple factors that may be interpreted as different facets of CI. This research extends our understanding of CI by suggesting that the original definition of CI was too all‐encompassing.

We consider how employees respond when coworkers provide them with benefits that violate ethical standards—a phenomenon we refer to as pro‐coworker unethical behavior (PCUB). Building on social exchange theory, we explore how recipients of PCUB may simultaneously experience both a sense of increased indebtedness toward their coworker, given the beneficial nature of PCUB, and reduced perceptions of their coworker's integrity, given the unethical nature of PCUB. We theorize that these diverging reactions will have countervailing indirect effects on the social exchange relationship between the recipient and PCUB provider. In turn, these effects on the social exchange relationship will influence whether the recipient responds favorably toward the provider, in the form of interpersonal citizenship. Our theoretical model incorporates the PCUB provider's prosocial versus self‐interested motives as a critical contingency that shapes recipients’ perceptions of indebtedness and integrity. The results of a multi‐wave field study of employee–coworker dyads and an experimental study provide converging support for our hypothesized model.</jats:p>",2021

Integrating aging and lifespan development research and inclusion work, we conduct a daily diary study to investigate age differences in employees’ responses to inclusion experience on a daily basis. In light of socioemotional selectivity theory, we argue that older workers exhibit stronger affective shifts (i.e., increase or upshift in positive affect and decrease or downshift in negative affect) in response to inclusion experience because they are likely to put higher value on social relationships, such that the daily effects of inclusion experience on changes in positive and negative affect are stronger for older (vs. younger) workers through the mediating mechanism of relationship value. We tested our hypotheses by surveying 128 employees from a manufacturing company for 10 consecutive workdays (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 1248). We found that the daily effects of inclusion experience on affective changes were stronger for older workers through the mediation of higher relationship value.

To do so, we leveraged the literature on embodied cognition and the challenge‐hindrance stressor framework to better understand how involving both the body and mind during learning (i.e., embodied learning) can lead to heightened perceptions of challenge stressors, which then result in greater psychological capital. We also expected that higher levels of psychological capital relate to greater subsequent adaptability on the job. We tested these predictions in two quasi‐experimental field studies. Study 1 included a sample of 141 executive MBA students and Study 2 included a sample of 163 working managers. In both studies, the disembodied learning condition consisted of classroom training. The embodied learning condition included an outdoor adventure training component (including an 88 km hiking race and various team challenges) conducted in the Gobi Desert in Study 1 and in a nature park in Study 2. The results of the first study revealed that participants in the embodied learning group experienced higher post‐learning psychological capital than those in the disembodied learning group and that psychological capital mediated the relationship between learning approach and peer‐rated adaptability 6 months later. Study 2 replicated the positive relationship between embodied learning and post‐learning psychological capital and extended it by showing that challenge stressors mediated this relationship.</jats:p>",2021

This study examines the impact of Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism—all operationalized as team composition variables—on team cooperation and performance over time. This was done in a sample of 43 graduate student teams (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 269) engaged in an immersive business simulation that unfolded over a 6‐week duration. In addition, the parameters of the simulation task were altered midway through the simulation without forewarning, in turn creating a shock event that allowed for an examination of whether team composition for negative personality had similar effects under conditions of business‐as‐usual versus a disruptive change. Results indicated that both team average Machiavellianism and sadism had deleterious effects on team cooperation and performance over time, while controlling for two closely associated positive personality traits (honesty‐humility and agreeableness). These damaging effects were further revealed to especially detract from performance trajectories after teams experienced a disruptive event. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of including problematic personality traits in considerations pertaining to team composition.</jats:p>",2021

Drawing upon the person‐environment fit framework, we proposed a negative relationship between high‐involvement work practices (HIWPs) and older workers’ retirement intention. We further developed hypotheses regarding the moderating effects of gender, age, educational level, managerial status, and external economic environment on the relationship between HIWPs and retirement intention. We tested the hypotheses using a sample of 754,856 employees aged 50 and over from 360 U.S. government agencies participating in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey from 2006 to 2015. The results, based on mixed effect logit regressions and cross‐classified modeling, indicated that older workers’ experience of HIWPs had a negative relationship with their retirement intention, and the negative relationship was stronger for older male workers, older workers aged 50–59 years, older workers without a bachelor's degree, and non‐managerial older workers than for older female workers, those aged 60 years or over, those with a bachelor's degree, and those with managerial responsibilities, respectively. Moreover, the results showed that the negative HIWPs‐retirement intention relationship has become stronger since the Great Recession of 2008. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of older workers’ retirement decisions by considering the interactions between human resource management practices and personal and environmental factors.</jats:p>",2021

Despite its widely recognized importance, several areas surrounding help‐seeking have not yet been clearly understood in the organization literature. Specifically, it is unclear whether seeking help always benefits employees in need, and how various work demands drive help‐seeking behavior in different ways. In this research, we drew from the dual‐type view of help‐seeking (i.e., autonomous and dependent help‐seeking) and the challenge‐hindrance stressors framework to elaborate how seeking help of different types influences employees’ work competence‐related outcomes in various directions, what work demands drive employees to seek different types of help, and when encountering work demands is particularly influential on their help‐seeking tendencies. Evidence from a field study (Study 1) showed that while challenge stressors increased employees’ autonomous help‐seeking, hindrance stressors increased dependent help‐seeking especially for employees with greater workflow centrality. Moreover, autonomous help‐seeking benefited help‐seekers’ job performance ratings through increased self‐perceived competence, whereas dependent help‐seeking hurt their job performance via decreased perceived competence by coworkers. To cross‐validate our findings, we then examined and replicated our core findings with three experimental vignette studies (Studies 2, 3a, and 3b).

We examine the validity of personality‐based AC ratings within a multi‐method framework. Drawing from the self‐other knowledge asymmetry model (Vazire, 2010), we propose that AC ratings are suited to capture personality traits that are observable in social interactions, whereas other methods (i.e., self‐ratings) are useful to assess more internal traits. We obtained data from two personality‐based ACs, self‐ and other‐rated personality inventories, and supervisor ratings of job performance. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that personality‐based AC ratings reflected the Big Five traits. Consistent with the self‐other knowledge asymmetry model, AC ratings of more observable personality traits (Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Intellect/Openness) were correlated with inventory‐based measures of these traits. AC ratings demonstrated incremental validity in predicting job performance over inventory‐based personality measures for some traits (including Agreeableness, and Intellect/Openness) but self‐ratings also demonstrated incremental validity over AC ratings (for Conscientiousness). This implies that different personality measures capture unique information, thereby complementing each other. Yet, AC effect sizes were modest, suggesting that running personality‐based ACs is advisable only under specific circumstances.</jats:p>",2021

The unidimensional agentic stereotype of these work contexts signals agentic job and organizational requirements (stereotypically male qualities such as achievement orientation), although the actual requirements usually also include communality (stereotypically female qualities such as interpersonal skills). In five experiments, we investigate the relevance of perceived applicant agency for perceived applicant fit, the influence of recruitment material, contextual differences, and the role of applicant gender. Our findings indicate that perceived applicant agency drives perceived person‐job and person‐organization fit in strictly male stereotyped work contexts, regardless of gender, and agentic recruitment material enhances this effect. Contrasting different contexts (high‐ with low‐status jobs and a male‐dominated with a gender‐balanced and female‐dominated field) revealed that the relevance of perceived agency increases with perceived job status, and the relevance of perceived communality decreases with the expected share of men. Although women were perceived as highly agentic in strictly male stereotyped work contexts, their need to be perceived as agentic also was higher than for men, due to the perceived lack of fit between women and high‐status jobs.</jats:p>",2021

We tested our model and research questions in a mixed methods study of 199 professor mentors. Our qualitative results provided a more in‐depth understanding of what mentors learn from their mentoring relationships with respect to mentoring‐specific knowledge, relational knowledge, and self‐knowledge. Furthermore, we identified occupational‐specific knowledge as an additional type of mentor knowledge acquisition. In our quantitative analysis, contrary to our hypothesis, we found that career mentoring self‐efficacy mediated a negative relationship between relationship quality and mentoring‐specific knowledge acquisition. Further, relationship quality had a direct, negative, effect on relational knowledge acquisition. Finally, career and psychosocial mentoring self‐efficacy positively related to occupational‐specific knowledge acquisition and together mediated the relation between relationship quality and occupational‐specific knowledge acquisition.

Although prior research has suggested that bias on the part of evaluators is the source of attractive individuals’ favorable career outcomes, there is also evidence that these individuals may be socialized to behave and perceive themselves differently from others in ways that contribute to their success. Building on socialization research and studies on nonverbal power cues, we examined nonverbal communication in individuals with varying degrees of physical attractiveness. In two experimental studies with data from 300 video interview pitches, we found that attractive individuals had a greater sense of power than their less
attractive counterparts and thus exhibited a more effective nonverbal presence, which led to higher managerial ratings of their hirability. However, we also identified a potential means for leveling this gap. Adopting a powerful posture was found to be especially beneficial for individuals rated low in attractiveness, enabling them to achieve the same level of effective nonverbal presence as their highly attractive counterparts naturally displayed. Our research sheds new light on the source of attractive individuals’ success and suggests a possible remedy for individuals who lack an appearance advantage.</jats:p>",2021

However, the theoretical link between team autonomy and team effectiveness is not well understood, and previous studies have found inconsistent relations between them. We aim to resolve this incomplete understanding by examining “why” autonomy relates to team effectiveness, “what” aspects of team effectiveness are affected by team autonomy, and “when” the relations vary. To do so, we investigated task‐ and relationship‐focused team functioning as mediators, expanded the construct of team effectiveness beyond just team performance to include attitudes, and tested the moderating effects of task routineness and interdependence. Our meta‐analyses based on 415 effect sizes from 69 studies conducted on approximately 6,035 teams revealed that team autonomy positively relates to both task‐ and relationship‐focused team functioning. The results showed significant indirect effects of autonomy on both team performance and attitudes via both types of team functioning. Task routineness weakened the effect of team autonomy on task‐focused functioning and, ultimately, on team performance and attitudes, while it did not change the effect on relationship‐focused functioning. The influence of team autonomy did not vary by the level of task interdependence. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</jats:p>",2021

We propose that (1) individuals shape PFP perceptions at different levels of mental construals, ranging from concrete to abstract; (2) concrete conceptualizations lead to specific, detailed, multidimensional perceptions of PFP system elements (i.e., expectancy, instrumentality, valence, and incentive‐intensity) while abstract conceptualizations lead to more general perceptions with fewer perceived dimensions; (3) an individual's construal level can change over time because of characteristics of the PFP system as well as external events, and (4) construal levels have different implications for PFP system effectiveness at the individual and organizational levels. We also discuss how this theoretical approach provides a structure for enhancing our understanding of modern pay practices that helps to close the gap that currently exists between compensation theory and practice.</jats:p>",2021

Prior research based on balance theory assumes that the two members have a consensus on the structure of the triadic relationship, to argue that when Member A perceives their LMX to be lower than that of Member B, such an LMX imbalance would drive Member A to interact negatively with Member B. Comparison of LMX, however, reflects one's subjective perception, which may not be shared by the other. Therefore, we draw on social comparison theory to examine both members’ comparisons of LMX simultaneously and suggest that when they both perceive the other's LMX as better than their own, they may engage more in affiliative behaviors and develop a higher‐quality coworker exchange (CWX). The results of two studies consistently supported these hypotheses. This research extends our understanding of LMX in triadic relations and demonstrates that mismatched perceptions of LMX dyadic comparison between two members (i.e., both perceive an LMX imbalance) could motivate members to develop a positive relationship.</jats:p>",2021

Further, these initial preferences significantly predicted job choice decisions at the end of the recruiting cycle. Applicants’ organizational attraction trajectories that developed during the entire recruiting process mediated this relationship. Findings in a laboratory sample (Study 2) were consistent with research on predecisional information distortion (PID).

Initial preferences had a significant indirect effect on job choice through total PID when the information about the two companies was equivalent and when the initially preferred company was moderately worse.

However, this effect remains puzzling given that disagreeableness is negatively associated with valued workplace behaviors, such as cooperation and prosocial behavior.

Such exchanges should allow disagreeable men to demonstrate higher job involvement, resulting in higher pay, especially when their wives demonstrate higher household performance and are highly conscientious.

Understanding the retention of former entrepreneurs—those who were previously founders of business ventures—is important to firms hoping to reap the benefits of their entrepreneurial experience. We compare the duration of their retention to other employees without entrepreneurial experience and propose a theoretical model in which entrepreneurial identity and job characteristics play a central role. The time‐dependent risk of voluntary turnover was estimated using survival analysis. Results from a primary survey collected from multiple firms in 2015–2018 (Study 1) reveal that former entrepreneurs quit sooner than others, and this effect was mediated by entrepreneurial identity. A second study using the NLSY79 and O*Net longitudinal dataset (Study 2) again supports this mediated relationship and further shows that the indirect effect through entrepreneurial identity was moderated such that employees with entrepreneurial identity stayed longer in jobs with favorable characteristics (i.e., high levels of work autonomy and more entrepreneurial opportunities) than other jobs. In Study 2, we were able to observe individuals’ careers over decades to capture the patterns of individual mobility—the back‐and‐forth exploration between businesses owned by self and others.

Drawing upon appraisal theory of emotion and the behavioral ethics literature, we predict that observing UPB would lead third parties to experience admiration due to the<jats:italic>pro‐organizational</jats:italic>nature of UPB; these third parties would in turn be motivated to display more helping behavior towards the UPB actor. Conversely, we predict that observing UPB would lead third parties to experience disgust due to the<jats:italic>unethical</jats:italic>nature of UPB; these third parties would dis‐identify themselves from the UPB actor by instigating incivility. Meanwhile, they would disengage themselves from the UPB actor by avoiding them in subsequent interactions. In addition, the observing employees might also engage in action‐oriented behavior such as whistle‐blowing behavior to sanction the UPB actor. Across an experience‐sampling study with three daily assessments as well as an experimental study, we find support for these predictions. Furthermore, we find that third parties’ moral attentiveness moderates the link between observed UPB and disgust, such that observed UPB leads to heightened feelings of disgust only when third parties have high levels of moral attentiveness. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our work.</jats:p>",2021

We argue that this is likely due to a continued focus on global assessments of LMX quality, rather than examination of the reciprocal, interlocked actions and reactions that take place daily between members of the dyad. A leader's affective state may indeed spark this reciprocal exchange process on a daily level and ultimately shape the state of the leader–follower relationship. In this study, we integrate LMX theory and emotions‐as‐social‐information (EASI) theory to examine how the leader's negative and positive affective states uniquely contribute to the reciprocal exchange process. In doing so, we advance understanding of the distinction of state LMX as well as the unique process for leader's negative affective state within the reciprocal exchange process. Using a 15‐day experience sampling methodology study of 76 leader–follower dyads, we find that a leader's positive and negative affective states transmit effects along the affective and inferential paths posited in EASI theory to influence follower performance on a daily basis. Interestingly, a leader's positive affective state is stronger along the affective path and a leader's negative affective state is stronger along the inferential path. We also find that leaders reciprocate the daily shift in follower performance with OCBI directed toward the follower. Finally, as expected, the reciprocal exchange process alters state LMX (leader rated).</jats:p>",2021

Finally, incremental validity analyses reveal that reflective thinking style explains unique variance in task performance, beyond conscientiousness and intelligence (general mental ability).

Situating our inquiry in the US hedge fund industry, we hypothesize two‐way interactions predicting that collaboration with a star comanager will weaken both the positive effect of comanaged fund success and the negative effect of comanaged fund failure on nonstar managers’ professional status attainment (i.e., the status of a manager's subsequent employing firm). Specifically, we argue that the involvement of a star comanager will weaken prospective employers’ attributions for positive or negative performance to a focal nonstar manager, due to presumptions of the star's disproportionate influence in collaborative decisions. We then theorize a series of three‐way interactions specifying the roles of other signals of a nonstar manager's competence in this process. More precisely, we argue that a nonstar's performance outside the collaborative context and the status of the nonstar's current employer will weaken the dampening effect of comanaging with a star in the context of success and strengthen the favorable, blame‐reducing effect of comanaging with a star in the context of failure. Therefore, we suggest that nonstars who can signal their competence with these independent status signals will achieve greater professional status attainment than will those lacking such signals following both collaborative success and collaborative failure with a star. Our primary analyses support our hypotheses, while our supplementary analyses offer corroborative support for theorized mechanisms and evidence to address alternative explanations.</jats:p>",2020

However, little is known about how and when newcomer learning adaptability drives innovative behaviors. Drawing on and extending individual adaptability theory, we propose that two mediating mechanisms, positive framing and task mastery, may transmit the effect of learning adaptability on innovative behavior, with supervisor's tendency to avoid uncertain situations posited as a boundary condition. The proposed hypotheses were tested using multi‐source, multi‐wave data from three companies. We found that learning adaptability indirectly impacts innovative behavior via positive framing but not via task mastery. In addition, supervisor uncertainty avoidance moderated the relationship between learning adaptability and positive framing, and task mastery moderated the relationship between positive framing and innovative behavior, supporting a pattern of moderated mediation, such that the indirect relationship between learning adaptability and innovative behavior via positive framing was more positive when both moderators were low. The research findings are discussed in terms of implications for socialization research and practice.</jats:p>",2020

Is LMX disagreement always detrimental for a follower's career? Can the examination of LMX agreement as a substantive variable help us cast new light on some of the inconclusive findings of past research on LMX and career outcomes? These questions motivate our research. Using theories of social exchange and sponsorship, and responses from 967 leader–follower dyads of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) professionals in seven European countries, we examined the role of LMX agreement on subjective and objective career outcomes. After conducting polynomial regression combined with response surface analysis, we found that both follower‐rated and leader‐rated employability were higher when the leader agreed with the follower at a high level of LMX (vs. a low level of LMX). In case of disagreement, strong support was found for leader‐rated employability being higher when the leader's perceptions of LMX exceeded those of their follower. Furthermore, follower‐rated employability was found to mediate the relationship between LMX (dis)agreement and perceived career success, promotions, salary, and bonuses. Support was also found for the mediating role of leader‐rated employability in the case of perceived career success, promotions, and salary but not for bonuses. Our findings highlight the importance of LMX (dis)agreement for career outcomes and further point to the possibility of employability offering an alternative explanation for the mixed findings of past LMX–career research.</jats:p>",2020

First, based on social network and homophily theories, we propose that racial minority candidates will be less likely to use diagnostic recruitment sources, and this lack of use contributes to less organizational attraction and greater withdrawal. Second, based on the realism hypothesis, we theorize that racial differences in accrued recruitment source diagnosticity contribute (in part) to racial differences in selection test performance. Using a sample of candidates in a high‐stakes selection context, we find that White applicants are significantly more likely to use the most diagnostic sources (compared to non‐Whites). Further, applicants with higher accrued recruitment source diagnosticity show greater organizational attraction (before and after testing), withdraw from the hiring process in fewer numbers, and perform significantly better on the selection tests. Altogether, these findings have important theoretical implications because they identify a fairly neglected determinant of recruitment and selection outcomes (accrued recruitment source diagnosticity) and may yield practical implications by suggesting actionable ways organizations can help reduce subgroup differences and enhance diversity.</jats:p>",2020

Findings from two multi‐wave, multisource field studies conducted with organizational leaders and an online experiment support hypotheses that leaders ruminate on their abusive behavior and this rumination triggers reconciliation efforts (a problem‐solving reaction) or the blaming of victims (a self‐serving reaction). In line with cognitive theories of rumination, leaders’ independent self‐construal functions as a key qualifier for the effects of rumination, such that when they ruminate, leaders who have low levels of independent self‐construal are more likely to seek reconciliation, whereas leaders who have high levels of independent self‐construal are more likely to blame their victims. Furthermore, reconciliation is not significantly related to subordinates’ evaluation of their leaders’ effectiveness but blaming is negatively related to it.

The impact of voluntary and involuntary turnover events on organizational “stayers” represents an unfortunate gap in extant turnover theory. Conceptualizing turnover as a beginning rather than an ending suggests the possibility that turnover events may increase, decrease, or have no effect on cognitions, decisions, and behaviors of those who remain in the organization. Yet, despite this possibility, we know very little about what happens to organizational members after turnover events occur. To address this gap, we develop Turnover Event Theory (TET). TET is a middle‐range, event‐centered theory that describes how turnover events first activate stayers’ attention and then are subject to a distinctive psychological interpretation process. By describing the processes that follow a turnover event, TET provides a needed explanation of how a turnover event may cause or derail downstream turnover events and change stayers’ behaviors and cognitions. We develop specific propositions to better understand this phenomenon and offer guidelines for future theoretical and empirical research.</jats:p>",2020

Using a three‐wave, multisource study with a round‐robin design (Study 1), we find that members who take charge relatively more in their work teams tend to be perceived as more competent and are more likely to emerge as informal leaders; however, they are also likely to be seen as less warm and receive less coworker support, especially in teams with a low initiative climate.

Results taken from a 3‐week, experience sampling study of supervisors suggest support for the impression management path; following episodes of abusive behavior, supervisors higher on symbolized moral identity become more concerned with their image, and thus engage in increased ingratiation, self‐promotion, and exemplification toward their subordinates. In contrast, we found no support for the genuine, moral cleansing path. This study thus extends knowledge regarding supervisors’ responses to their own abusive behavior, challenging the existing notion that such responses are genuine and focused on addressing the moral implications of the behavior.</jats:p>",2020

In Study 2, we replicated these findings in a commercial real estate firm and expanded understanding of how GSP may serve as a cross‐level moderator of non‐star performance and two critical individual differences germane to learning: non‐star tenure and trait negative affect.

CEOs with available financial resources who also hold a high view of employee trustworthiness (i.e., warmth) and ability (i.e., competence) are likely to utilize higher levels of HPWS. Further, employee perceptions of CEO warmth and competence moderate the relationship between HPWS utilization and firm performance, such that high levels of perceived CEO warmth and competence enhance the efficacy of HPWS.

Venting may benefit the self via the release of negative emotion, or by acting as a catalyst for changes to problematic work situations. Nonetheless, venting might have unintended consequences via its influence on those who are the recipients of venting from others. In light of this idea, we provide a theoretical explanation for how leaders in particular are affected by venting receipt at work. Drawing from the transactional model of stress, we theorize that venting tends to be appraised as a threat, which triggers negative emotion that, in turn, potentiates deviant action tendencies (i.e., interpersonal mistreatment). Yet, our theory suggests that not all leaders necessarily experience venting in the same way. Specifically, leaders with higher need for cognition are less influenced by surface‐level cues associated with others’ emotional expressions and find challenging interpersonal situations to be less aversive, thereby attenuating the deleterious effects of receipt of venting. In an experience sampling study of 112 managers across 10 consecutive workdays, we find support for our theoretical model. Altogether, our findings provide insight into the costs incurred when leaders lend an ear to those who vent, which can result in negative downstream consequences.</jats:p>",2020

Moreover, given that CET is fundamentally a theory of goal attainment, we examine the downstream impact of routine disruptions on employees’ work goal progress. Results from two daily experience‐sampling studies show that when employees’ morning routines were disrupted, employees experienced higher levels of depletion and reduced calmness. In turn, depletion was associated negatively, and calmness was associated positively, with daily work engagement.

Moderated mediation analyses indicate that this effect is driven by a perceived lack of job fit (Experiments 1 and 2). Results of Experiment 3 indicate that this moderation effect is limited to candidates who signal morality—candidates applying for jobs in morally tainted industries who signal immorality do not enjoy a competitive advantage over moral or morally neutral candidates. Finally, the framing of the organization, that is, whether critical aspects of the organization are presented as more morally or economically oriented, within morally tainted industries helps mitigate the penalizing effects interviewers put on candidates who signal their morality—a moral frame eliminates this negative effect whereas an economic frame does not (Experiment 4). Together, these studies indicate that a job candidate's morality is a complicated and important quality that can profoundly affect his/her ratings of hireability.</jats:p>",2020

To promote healthy behavior among employees, some companies use tailored online health platforms, which are customizable and accessible. Although these programs are available to all employees, they differ in terms of their participation, and we do not understand the reasons underlying variations in the use of these programs. We also have a limited understanding of the potential organizational outcomes of such participation. Thus, in this study, we develop a model of the antecedents and outcomes of employees’ participation in an organization's online health program. We propose that employees’ health beliefs, social influence to participate, and intention to participate influence their participation in an organization's online health program, which is associated with their health behavior within the organization. In turn, employees’ organizational health behavior influences organizationally relevant outcomes through mediation by availability of task‐ and family‐related support from coworkers. We tested our model through a four‐phase, multisource study by using data from 331 employees working in an Indian information technology company. Results generally supported our model. Our findings contribute to our knowledge of employees’ health behavior by examining why they may participate in online health programs and how their participation may promote health behavior and lead to organizationally relevant outcomes.</jats:p>",2020

In addition, we propose that the moderating effects of the performance and personal liking bases of LMX differentiation are magnified by the levels of reward interdependence. Specifically, under a high (vs. low) level of reward interdependence, LMX differentiation based on performance more strongly relates to high group cooperation and low group social undermining, whereas LMX differentiation with a personal liking basis is more likely to decrease group cooperation and increase group social undermining. Group cooperation and social undermining are then hypothesized to convey the three‐way interactive effects of LMX differentiation, its two bases, and reward interdependence on subsequent group performance. Analyses of data from 328 sales groups of a large retailer support the core part of our contingency model of LMX differentiation.</jats:p>",2020

Integrating arguments from shared leadership and team development theory, we examine how shared leadership changes over the course of a project team's life cycle and how this pattern of change relates to team performance. Guided by shared leadership theory and project team literature, we also explore team‐level factors, which may alter the pattern of shared leadership development. In particular, we propose that in project teams shared leadership develops in a nonuniform way, approximating an inverted U‐shaped pattern, increasing early in the team's life cycle, peaking around the midpoint, and then decreasing in the later phase. In turn, this development pattern relates positively to team performance. We also extend theory by explaining how specific team characteristics influence the pattern of shared leadership development. Using a three‐study approach, we empirically examine the hypothesized relationships and conclude with a general discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.</jats:p>",2020

However, it remains unknown whether the same relationship holds at the team level. In this research, we propose and test a curvilinear relationship between team mean level of proactive personality and team performance. We also examine team potency and team cohesion as the explanatory mechanisms and the dispersion of proactive personality as a boundary condition for the relationship. We conducted two studies to test these ideas. In Study 1, we collected data from 93 teams in four companies from different industries. In Study 2, we collected data from 101 nursing teams in three hospitals. We found a curvilinear relationship between team mean level of proactive personality and team performance in Study 1 and replicated it in Study 2. We further demonstrated in Study 2 the moderating role of dispersion of proactive personality and the mediating role of team potency and team cohesion, respectively, in this curvilinear relationship. The positive trend of the curvilinear relationship is strengthened (weakened) when the dispersion of proactive personality is high (low). The negative trend is mitigated under high dispersion of proactive personality but is not significant under low dispersion of proactive personality. Practically, managers must be aware that team mean level of proactive personality benefits team performance only up to a certain point.</jats:p>",2020

In addition, research is beginning to examine employees’ family context along with their experiences both at work and at home. We advance these literatures using shared reality theory as a foundation for investigating couples’ dyadic agreement surrounding employee depersonalization and its implications. Using polynomial regression and response surface methodology of data from employee‐significant other dyads, in Study 1, we find that agreement between partners on employee depersonalization is associated with lower work‐to‐family conflict (following general shared reality theory arguments) and increased subsequent recovery for the employee. In Study 2, we examine more specific shared reality theory arguments using the same analytic approach. We show that agreement between partners on employee depersonalization is associated with less distress and an increased perception that one's depersonalization is understood, and ultimately increased recovery for the employee via reductions in distress. Taken together, these results suggest the harmful effects of depersonalization are largely minimized if an employee's partner accurately recognizes their depersonalization. Interestingly, our collective results show it is better for employees to have agreement with their partners surrounding a high level of employee depersonalization than have low levels of depersonalization accompanied by disagreement.</jats:p>",2020

In only two of six cases (i.e., rugged outdoors and administrative interests), did the person–occupation interest congruence effect disappear after controlling for the person–occupation gender congruence effect; the gender congruence effect also remained significant after controlling for the interest congruence effect. Consequently, the two cross‐level interactions on job performance (for vocational interests and for gender) appear to represent distinct effects.

Integrating cognitive perspectives on time urgency with contemporary thinking on the psychological experience of status, we reason that supervisors’ time‐urgent personality relates positively with their autocratic leadership behavior, and we cast supervisors’ self‐perceived status as a moderator of this linkage. Moreover, we enrich this leader‐centric perspective with a complementary, more follower‐centric view, recognizing that the consequences of supervisors’ time urgency likely extend beyond their own behavior to indirectly affect their subordinates’ well‐being at work. We tested our hypotheses using a field sample of 60 supervisors and 277 of their subordinates. Results indicate that (a) supervisors with higher time urgency are more likely to exhibit autocratic leadership behavior when they also perceive themselves as having relatively high status among subordinates, but not when perceiving lower status, and (b) supervisors’ time urgency exhibits a conditional indirect effect (via autocratic leadership) on subordinates’ work stress and time pressure experiences. Hence, this study illustrates an important boundary condition for the consequences of supervisors’ time urgency, and it demonstrates that this personality characteristic not only shapes supervisors’ leadership behavior but also affects the subordinates they are charged with leading.</jats:p>",2020

Specifically, we propose that management teams with a denser singular leadership network (i.e., a network consisting of many leadership ties that are not coupled with friendship ties) should have lower management team cohesion, which subsequently renders worse business unit performance. To contrast, management teams with a denser multiplex network (i.e., a network consisting of many leadership ties that are coupled with friendship ties) should have higher management team cohesion, which subsequently renders better business unit performance. Guided by structural contingency perspective, we further propose that management team task interdependence will strengthen team cohesion's positive impact on business unit performance. To test the hypothesized model, we collected team‐level social network data and multiple‐wave survey data from 697 managers nested in 148 hotels (i.e., 148 management teams) owned by a large hospitality company. We also obtained objective performance data for each hotel (i.e., occupancy percentage rate and revenue per available room per day) as the criterion measure. The data supported our hypotheses.

Yet, although many employees imitate the unethical behavior of their coworkers, some adhere to ethical standards in spite of their coworkers’ unethical behavior. Drawing on social cognitive theory, we propose an expanded model of unethical social influence that sheds light on the processes and boundary conditions associated with unethical contagion within organizations. Specifically, we argue that observing others engage in unethical behavior evokes feelings of envy that, in turn, facilitate moral disengagement and unethicality. We then integrate research on cognitive reappraisal with the moral disengagement literature to propose that cognitive reappraisal attenuates the experience of envy in those who observe unethical behavior. Across two field studies and an experimental study, we build a model in which envy mediates the relationship between observed unethical behavior and moral disengagement with downstream consequences in the form of unethical behavior. Additionally, both cognitive reappraisal orientation (Studies 1 &amp; 2) and cognitive reappraisal training (Study 3) attenuate this mediated effect. Given the substantial costs of unethical contagion within organizations, these findings have implications for both scholars and managers.</jats:p>",2020

Underlying this perspective is the assumption that all leader behaviors that encourage “normatively appropriate conduct” will influence followers in a similar fashion. Put differently, the current consensus seems to suggest that actions that focus on preventing unethical behavior—attending to “the wrong”—will have the same impact as actions that focus on promoting ethical behavior—attending to “the right.” Taking a within‐person approach, we draw upon social exchange theory to challenge this consensus and build theory that suggests a follower's felt trust from their leader will be differentially impacted by prevention‐ versus promotion‐focused ethical leadership. We also explore how these different types of ethical leadership may indirectly, through felt trust, impact citizenship behavior and counterproductive work behavior. Finally, we consider how the role of the “moral manager” may interact with the “moral person” by identifying leader moral hypocrisy as an important between‐person moderator of these effects.

Specifically, across three studies (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub>Total</jats:sub> = 1,239), we first tested whether situation construal (i.e., the individual perception of situations in SJTs) predicts responses to SJT items. Second, we assessed whether the relevance of situation construal for SJT performance depends on test elements (i.e., situation descriptions and response options) and item features (i.e., description‐dependent vs. description‐independent SJT items). Lastly, we determined whether situation construal has incremental validity for job‐related criteria over and above SJT performance. The results showed that, for most SJT items, situation construal significantly contributed to SJT performance, even if only response options were available. This was also true for SJT items that are significantly more difficult to solve when situation descriptions are omitted (i.e., description‐dependent SJT items). Finally, situation construal explained variance in relevant criteria over and above SJT performance. Despite recent efforts to reconceptualize SJTs, our results suggest that they can still be viewed as situational measures. However, situation descriptions may be less crucial for these underlying situational processes. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</jats:p>",2020

Meeting these assumptions is important for researchers seeking to accurately partition the variance in effect sizes due to study artifacts from the variance due to meaningful moderators. Despite the critical role of these assumptions, we know very little about their tenability. To address this basic gap in the literature, we conducted three studies to determine if there are potential violations of the independence assumptions (Study 1), the prevalence of such violations (Study 2), and the consequences of violating the independence assumptions via a series of Monte Carlo simulations (Study 3). We found that violations of the independence assumptions are not only plausible but also routinely detected across a wide array of topics. Simulation results indicate that violating the independence assumptions can result in biases under certain circumstances, which are further accentuated due to the lack of stability in the estimators. We offer suggestions for the future use of psychometric meta‐analysis and discuss the implications for research focused on refining psychometric meta‐analysis.</jats:p>",2019

However, we highlight two important shortcomings of these past studies and use meta‐analytic and computation modeling techniques to address these two shortcomings. In Study 1, an updated meta‐analysis of the Hispanic–White mean difference (<jats:italic>d</jats:italic>‐value) on job performance was carried out. In Study 2, computation modeling was used to correct the Study 1 <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>‐values for indirect range restriction and combine them with other meta‐analytic parameters relevant to predictive bias to determine how often cognitive ability test scores underpredict Hispanic applicants’ job performance. Hispanic applicants’ job performance was underpredicted by a small to moderate amount in most conditions of the computation model. In contrast to previous studies, this suggests cognitive ability tests can be expected to exhibit predictive bias against Hispanic applicants much of the time. However, some conditions did not exhibit underprediction, highlighting that predictive bias depends on various selection system parameters, such as the criterion‐related validity of cognitive ability tests and other predictors used in selection. Regardless, our results challenge “lack of predictive bias” as a rationale for supporting test use.</jats:p>",2019

We suggest that activation level prompts unethical behavior. Based on the affective infusion model (AIM; Forgas, 1995), we predict that positive activated and negative activated moods facilitate unethical behavior to benefit a teammate, via the mediating mechanism of a creative mindset. We test our full model using an experience sampling method over 2 weeks, in which mood and creative mindset were assessed in the morning and unethical behavior conducted that day was assessed in the evening. We found that activated moods (both positive and negative) were positively related to unethical behavior to benefit a teammate. Further, creative mindset mediated the relationship between positive activated mood and unethical behavior to benefit a teammate. Consistent with AIM's claim that mood should influence decisions more when they are not personally relevant, we found that moral disengagement propensity moderated this indirect effect. In addition, we conducted two experiments to examine further the mood‐creative mindset and creative mindset‐unethical behavior to benefit a teammate relationship. Our findings affirm that activated versus deactivated moods facilitate a creative mindset, and that a creative mindset encourages unethical behavior to benefit a teammate. Our findings suggest that activation level of mood plays a critical role in unethical behavior.</jats:p>",2019

Complementing this approach, we draw on an attribution theory perspective to delineate how proactive personality relates to employee creativity through the serial mediating effects of job reflective learning—a backward‐looking cognitive process—and activated positive affective states. Job reflective learning captures backward‐looking self‐assessments and the underlying internal causal attributions, and it is differentiated into two valences: job reflective learning from successes and from failures. Based on two separate multi‐wave, multi‐source field studies, our findings consistently show a serial mediation process linking proactive personality to creativity through both valences of job reflective learning and activated positive affective states. Job reflective learning from successes breeds joviality, whereas job reflective learning from failures arouses attentiveness. Joviality and attentiveness—both types of activated positive affective states—in turn promote creativity. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of how proactive employees manifest their proactivity trait into actual creativity through backward‐looking cognitive and affective processes.</jats:p>",2019

Although some employees continue to support their leaders after learning of their unethical actions, others do not. In this paper, we integrate social cognitive theory with social information processing theory to propose that the support employees give to leaders who act unethically hinges on their propensity to morally disengage. Specifically, we develop a conditional indirect effects model, wherein moral disengagement propensity mitigates the negative impact of unethical leader behavior on leader‐directed support via employees’ perceptions of value congruence with and trust in the leader. The sum result is an improved understanding of when and why employees offer support to versus withhold support from leaders who act in ethically questionable ways.</jats:p>",2019

They found that gender and being designated a high‐potential employee interacted in accounting for pay and that this resulted in a reversal in the commonly observed gender pay gap favoring men. Our primary aim was to examine important boundary conditions associated with their work by (a) conducting a study using a sample that would better generalize across industries and to individuals who aspire to reach senior management, (b) adding critical control variables to the statistical models used in the pay equation, and (c) by introducing a different conceptualization of the high‐potential construct. Also, to better understand the consequences of their study, we considered an additional dependent variable that addressed pay satisfaction. Even after making these model additions, the gender by high‐potential interaction term was significant—ruling out four plausible third‐variable explanations for the Leslie et al. finding. Moreover, these confirming results were observed using a sample that represented individuals employed in a wide range of industries, who had the educational backgrounds, career histories, and motivational states typically required of candidates competing for senior executive roles. Furthermore, high‐potential women did not report higher levels of pay satisfaction, suggesting that high‐potential women did not perceive their pay premium to be an inequitable advantage and that there may be limited positive return associated with using a pay premium to retain high‐potential talent.</jats:p>",2019

Our model also elucidates the processes that cause powerlessness to reduce social closeness, demonstrating that employees’ affiliation motive and their expectation of others’ interest in affiliating explain this relationship. We further propose that the effect of powerlessness on social closeness will be stronger for employees high (vs. low) in political skill because these employees are more attuned to workplace power dynamics. We find support for our model in an experience‐sampling field experiment and two experimental scenario studies. Our research clarifies the effects of powerlessness on social closeness and organizationally relevant downstream consequences, qualifies dominant assumptions that the powerless always behave in ways opposite those of the powerful, and demonstrates the importance of political skill as a moderator of power's effects.</jats:p>",2019

Considering these effects on women's careers, researchers have sought to understand the underlying dynamics of these decisions.

We integrate stereotype threat and benevolent sexism theories to explain how the effects of help on postpartum intentions to quit may be transmitted through reductions in work self‐efficacy. In doing so, we consider the role of <jats:italic>perceived impact</jats:italic>—or the extent to which help interferes with versus enables women's perceived ability to continue performing their work role. Results of a weekly diary study of 105 pregnant employees suggest that work‐interfering help led to decreased self‐efficacy for work during the following week. Furthermore, there was an indirect effect of average help received at work during pregnancy on postpartum intentions to quit the workforce through reductions in work self‐efficacy that was stronger insofar as help was work‐interfering versus work‐enabling. Taken together, our results highlight unintended negative consequences that occur when others provide ineffective support to women at work during pregnancy.</jats:p>",2019

Second, we utilize socioemotional selectivity theory to overcome the current age‐blind view on workplace interactions and examine the indirect moderating effect of age via future time perspective on the link between contact quality, social mindfulness, and coworker support. We tested our hypotheses based on data from a sample of 575 employees collected in three waves. Results showed that both coworker‐oriented perspective taking and empathic concern mediated the positive effects of contact quality on coworker support. The effect of contact quality on coworker‐oriented empathic concern was stronger for older employees with a more constrained future time perspective as compared to younger employees with a more extensive future time perspective. Overall, we extend research on aging, workplace interactions, and support behavior by linking the literature on these topics using a social mindfulness lens and by adding employee age and age‐related mechanisms as important boundary conditions that qualify the outcomes of positive workplace contact.</jats:p>",2019

However, research has yet to consider how and why BLMs may result in both beneficial and dysfunctional organizational outcomes. In the present research, we examine employees’ perceptions of top management's BLM as a type of business frame that results in two cognitive states. Under the influence of this business frame, employees may adopt a mental preoccupation with work (i.e., a state of ongoing work‐related cognitions) that propels beneficial employee outcomes by reducing customer incivility and enhancing customer service performance. Yet, also in response to top management's high BLM as a business frame, employees may adopt self‐interest cognitions (i.e., a cognitive state of self‐interest) that instigate customer‐directed unethical conduct. Across two field studies, we found general support for our hypotheses. Taken together, our findings suggest that perceptions of top management's high BLM can be a mixed blessing in that it may drive employees to adopt focused work efforts (mental preoccupation with work), but also self‐interest cognitions, with each cognitive state predicting beneficial or dysfunctional behaviors.

One aspect of this dark side that has received relatively scant attention is “helping pressure”—an employee's perception that s/he is being encouraged to, or otherwise feels that s/he should, enact helping behavior at work. Drawing from theory associated with work stress, we examine affective and cognitive mechanisms that potentially explain why helping pressure, counterintuitively, may lead employees to engage in deviant behavior instead. Beyond examining these possible mechanisms, we also answer calls to identify a potential buffer to these effects. Drawing from self‐determination theory, we examine how an employee's intrinsic motivation for citizenship may lessen the deleterious consequences of helping pressure at work. In two studies (a within‐individual experience‐sampling study and a two‐wave between‐individual study), we find consistent evidence that helping pressure has a positive indirect relationship with deviant behavior through increased negative affect. Further, we find evidence that intrinsic motivation for citizenship weakens the positive relationship of helping pressure with negative affect, buffering the indirect effect on subsequent deviant behavior.

Apart from assessing measurement validity of the item response process, we examined predictive validity; that is, whether or not different response models entail differential selection outcomes. We found that ideal point response models fit slightly better than dominance response models across high‐ versus low‐stakes situations in both studies. Additionally, fitting ideal point models to the data led to fewer items displaying differential item functioning compared to fitting dominance models. We also identified several items that functioned as intermediate items in both the faking and honest conditions when ideal point models were fitted, suggesting that ideal point model is “theoretically” more suitable across these contexts for personality inventories. However, the use of different response models (dominance vs. ideal point) did not have any substantial impact on the validity of personality measures in high‐stakes situations, or the effectiveness of selection decisions such as mean performance or percent of fakers selected. These findings are significant in that although prior research supports the importance and use of ideal point models for measuring personality, we find that in the case of personality faking, though ideal point models seem to have slightly better measurement validity, the use of dominance models may be adequate with no loss to predictive validity.</jats:p>",2019

In addition, we examined how individuals changed membership across two time points (separated by 6 years), antecedents of class membership (role tenure and union commitment), and outcomes (freerider intentions and actual financial contributions to the union's political action fund). The six classes differed uniquely, in terms of the ways people participate, changes in how people participate over time, what predicted class membership, and how class membership impacts two outcomes. The current study demonstrates that person‐centered approaches can both clarify previous conflicting findings within the participation literature and predict meaningful outcomes.</jats:p>",2019

With a coherent organizational identity acting as both a sensemaking tool and a means of potential self‐enhancement for employees, we use social identity theory to hypothesize that similarly emphasized promotion and prevention climates are negatively related to employees’ collective organizational commitment and indirectly, negatively related to organizational productivity. We test our hypotheses in a sample of 107 manufacturing organizations, using polynomial regression with response surface analysis to examine how similarly emphasized promotion and prevention climates relate to collective commitment and organizational productivity. Our analyses reveal that as organization‐level promotion and prevention climate scores became more similar, collective organizational commitment decreases. Furthermore, we find that similarly emphasized promotion and prevention climates are negatively related to organizational productivity via collective commitment.

Scholars argue that organizations can promote cross‐unit ties by: (a) formally bringing together individuals from different business units into structural links (e.g., cross‐unit strategic committees) to encourage the formation of new cross unit ties and, (b) transferring individuals across units, which can increase cross‐unit interaction when ties to the prior unit are maintained. This study considers the notion that the success of these formal interventions in fostering cross‐unit interaction is contingent on identification with the local unit relative to identification with the broader organization. Specifically, we propose that structural links are more likely to foster cross‐unit ties when organizational identification is high and unit identification is low. In contrast, lateral transfers are more likely to result in cross‐unit ties when both organizational identification and unit identification are high.

Despite this, surprisingly little is known about the criterion‐related validity of prehire experience, which reflects the amount, duration, or type of experience workers have acquired before they enter a new organization. To address this critical gap in the literature, we used meta‐analysis to synthesize data from 81 independent samples that reported relations between prehire experience and performance or turnover. Results revealed overall corrected correlations of .06 for job performance (<jats:italic>k</jats:italic> = 44, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 11,785), .11 for training performance (<jats:italic>k</jats:italic> = 21, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 8,176), and .00 for turnover (<jats:italic>k</jats:italic> = 32, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 11,676). Measures that capture prehire experience with tasks, jobs, or occupations relevant to workers’ current position also are only weakly related to the outcomes (e.g., <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""graphic/peps12335-math-0001.png"" xlink:title=""urn:x-wiley:00315826:media:peps12335:peps12335-math-0001"" /> = .07 for job performance). Two exceptions to our main findings are that (a) prehire experience is somewhat more predictive of job performance when workers first start a new job and (b) measures of task‐level experience predict training performance, although these results are based on small subsets of primary studies. Overall, the present findings suggest that the types of prehire experience measures organizations currently use to screen job applicants generally are poor predictors of future performance and turnover.

We conducted an experiment with a sample of 109 undergraduate students (32 teams) enrolled in a business plan competition (Study 1) and a field survey based on multisource, time‐lagged data collected from 251 full‐time employees working on 64 research and development teams (Study 2). The results from both studies revealed that shared leadership enhanced team members’ individual creative self‐efficacy and individual creativity, which in turn improved team creativity. Moreover, the results from Study 2 showed that a formally appointed leader's use of different transformational leadership behaviors had different impacts on individual and team creativity. Individual‐focused transformational leadership strengthened the positive effect of shared leadership on team members’ average individual creativity, whereas group‐focused transformational leadership facilitated the translation of teams with high average individual creativity into teams with high levels of team creativity.

However, the nature of the relationship between team tenure and team performance is unclear due to underdeveloped theory on the nature of team tenure, various unintegrated theoretical conceptualizations of team tenure, and mixed empirical findings. Further, there is a lack of theory as to the intervening team processes and emergent states that account for the “black box” of the team tenure–team performance relationship. Accordingly, we conducted meta‐analyses of the relationships of team tenure with team processes and performance. Our results, based on 622 effect sizes reported in 169 studies, show that team tenure, conceptualized as additive team tenure, collective team tenure, and team tenure dispersion, is positively related to team performance. Relative weights analysis found additive team tenure to be a relatively more important predictor of team performance than collective team tenure or team tenure dispersion. We found that team cognition, motivational‐affective states, and behavioral processes mediate the relationships of additive team tenure, collective team tenure, and team tenure dispersion with team performance, respectively.

Although scholars have increasingly begun to theorize and conceptualize the job search in this manner, little is known about what fosters effective self‐regulation week‐to‐week. In light of this theoretical gap, we integrate self‐regulation theory with the feedback literature to examine how feedback quality influences affective, cognitive, and behavioral regulatory processes in job search. Furthermore, we examine feedback self‐efficacy (i.e., how efficacious a job seeker feels with respect to processing and implementing feedback received during the job search) as a stable, person‐level moderator of these within‐person relationships. In a sample of job seekers surveyed once a week for seven weeks, results indicate that receiving high‐quality feedback has a direct influence on positive and negative affective reactions tied to the job search, influencing subsequent positive (i.e., metacognitive strategies) and negative (i.e., affective rumination) cognitive processes. Metacognitive strategies, in turn, impact both the number of résumés sent and hours spent job seeking each week. Moreover, lower feedback self‐efficacy amplifies the relationship between feedback quality and negative affective reactions. Our results highlight the importance of high‐quality feedback in helping job seekers effectively regulate week‐to‐week.</jats:p>",2019

First, we suggest functional diversity will result in higher levels of shared leadership but will only be realized when teams elicit a cooperative climate. Second, we suggest that gender diversity, a salient social category, will have a negative impact on shared leadership, particularly in a low cooperative climate.

Those with more proactive personalities may be more likely to experience these detachment difficulty problems after displaying or witnessing innovative behavior. To test these premises, we conducted two studies.

Drawing upon the integration‐and‐learning perspective for managing diversity, Study 1 finds that a synergy diversity climate moderates the relationship between employee seniority and supervisor‐rated creative job performance lending support to our hypothesis. Study 2 provides an extension by showing how creative process engagement mediates this moderating effect on self‐rated creative performance. Finally, Study 3 replicates and extends Study 2 by demonstrating the mediating role of creative process engagement but utilizing supervisor‐rated creative job performance, while again showing synergy diversity climate to be an important boundary condition. In sum, we find that synergy diversity climate, as opposed to fairness and discrimination diversity climate, interacts with employee seniority by facilitating greater creative process engagement for newcomers subsequently impacting creative job performance. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for how the individual‐level creative job performance effects may represent a microfoundation to creative team dynamics that confer a sustainable competitive advantage.</jats:p>",2019

These discrete emotions, in turn, tend to precipitate distinct responses that do not directly target the supervisor. We tested our hypotheses with a three‐wave, time‐lagged survey of 285 full‐time workers from 55 work units. Consistent with our theorizing, supervisory abuse was associated with stronger feelings of shame while at work when the abusive supervision reported by one's coworkers was lower (vs. higher), whereas abuse had a stronger association with anger when coworkers also perceived relatively high levels of abuse. The distinct action tendencies associated with shame and anger are related to employees engaging in less voice behavior and more interpersonal deviance, respectively, and fear is related to higher turnover intentions. We discuss the study's implications for theory development concerning abusive supervision.</jats:p>",2019

Do employees react to how long a procedure takes, not just how fair it seems to be? To explore that question, we examined the potential effects of procedural timeliness using six theories created to explain the benefits of procedural justice. This integrative theory‐based approach allowed us to explore whether “how long” had unique effects apart from “how fair.” The results of a three‐wave, two‐source field study showed that procedural timeliness had a significant indirect effect on citizenship behavior through many of the theory‐based mechanisms, even when controlling for procedural justice. A laboratory study then replicated those effects while distinguishing procedures that were too fast versus too slow. We discuss the implications of our results for research on fostering citizenship behavior and improving supervisors’ decision‐making procedures.</jats:p>",2019

The first perspective, functional leadership theory, is the dominant lens used currently to understand informal leadership. However, we suggest that social learning theory offers a compelling alternative account. In a multiwave survey study of 344 members of 72 work teams, we find support for the social learning theory predictions that laissez‐faire formal leaders are perceived by team members to engage in less modeling of effective leadership and as a result are negatively associated with informal leadership and team task performance. We do not find support for the functional leadership theory predictions that laissez‐faire formal leaders are positively associated with team members’ informal leadership and team task performance, which would be due to an increased perceived need for leadership. The social learning effects are stronger for teams that are lower in member MTL and weaker for teams that are higher in member MTL. These results suggest social learning theory may be preferable to functional leadership theory for understanding informal leadership in teams.</jats:p>",2018

Results indicate that, through occupational prestige and subsequent psychological job demands and financial well‐being, GMA was related to work‐to‐family conflict (WFC) and family‐to‐work conflict (FWC). GMA was also related to work‐to‐family enrichment (WFE) but not family‐to‐work enrichment (FWE) through occupational prestige and autonomy. In contrast, conscientiousness did not influence work–family outcomes through occupational prestige. Additionally, GMA and conscientiousness were both related to WFE/FWE through problem coping, whereas conscientiousness was related to FWC through avoidance coping. Examining the relative effects of GMA and conscientiousness, we found that the indirect effects of GMA through occupational prestige were stronger than those of conscientiousness, whereas the indirect effects of conscientiousness through problem coping were stronger than those of GMA.

To test this model, we conducted a multistudy investigation involving different samples, designs, and data‐analytic methods. In Study 1, we conducted an experiment and found that participants who envisioned working in a firm that was active regarding CSR activities reported greater pride and organizational embeddedness. We then conducted two field studies using a nonmanagerial sample (Study 2) and a managerial sample (Study 3) and found that participants’ perceived CSR was positively related to their pride, which in turn was related to stronger organizational embeddedness. Stronger organizational embeddedness was related to lower turnover 6 months later in Study 2 but not in Study 3. In Study 4, we conducted a longitudinal four‐wave 14‐month study to test the proposed relationships from a within‐person conceptualization, and the results were also supportive.

Extending this work by drawing from the social functional perspective on emotion, we propose that customers’ negative emotional responses to environmental stressors in organizations can exert both dysfunctional and functional effects on customer–employee interactions. Specifically, we theorize that situational and physiological forms of environmental stressors can be dysfunctional by incurring customer anger, precipitating customer aggression, and diminishing employee helpfulness. We further theorize that situational relative to physiological stressors can exert functional effects in inducing customer fear that elicits empathy and helpfulness from employees. We test our model via an archival, observational, and critical incident yoked experimental study set in the airport context. This research contributes to stress theory and its organizational application by integrating theory from the social functional approach to emotion with appraisal‐based theories of stress in organizations.</jats:p>",2018

IM includes behaviors intended to create an impression of competence and likability, and avoid negative impressions. Applicants can influence interviewers’ impressions using both honest and deceptive IM, but measurement of IM has yet to distinguish these two constructs. The goal of the present research was to develop a self‐report Honest Interview Impression Management (HIIM) measure and use this to investigate differential antecedents and consequences of honest and deceptive IM. We report the results of five independent studies (total <jats:italic>N =</jats:italic> 1,470 interviewees). Studies 1–3 detail the creation of a self‐report measure of honest IM. Studies 4 and 5 utilize this measure to understand the relations between honest and deceptive IM, and their antecedents and consequences. Results demonstrate that honest and deceptive IM are positively related but distinct constructs that have unique antecedents (i.e., age, individual differences, attitudes, situational, and target characteristics) and differentially impact interview outcomes and ratings. Finally, we present a short measure of honest and deceptive IM to be used for time‐sensitive data collection.</jats:p>",2018

Drawing from the “Red Queen” notion in competitive strategy and from conservation of resources theory, we argue that although organizational reputation can cause employees to identify more strongly with the organization, it may also pressure employees to commit more of their time to the job. In turn, increased organizational identification and time commitment have contrasting effects on employees’ emotional exhaustion. Following recent theorizing in the reputation literature, we also test the proposal that the effects of organizational reputation—a collective‐level representation—are mediated through employees’ individual‐level perceptions. Taken together, our theoretical model suggests that organizational reputation, through employees’ perceptions of that reputation, simultaneously serves as a benefit that reduces emotional exhaustion via organizational identification, but also as a burden that increases emotional exhaustion via additional time commitment. In turn, we demonstrate that these dynamics have both positive and negative implications for employees’ counterproductive work behavior. Our arguments are confirmed in a multiwave, multisource study of employees from a diverse range of organizations.</jats:p>",2018

Although previous studies have identified numerous gender‐specific antecedents such as sex similarity and climate for sexual harassment, the present study considers the role of a more general contextual construct—organizational justice climate. Beyond examining justice climate as a predictor of sexual harassment, we also assess its potential moderation of well‐established relationships between antecedents (i.e., climate for sexual harassment and sex similarity) and sexual harassment at both the individual and unit levels. In two large military samples (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>s = 26,018 and 8,197), we found that psychological and collective justice climates (a) related negatively to sexual harassment and (b) moderated the effects of sex similarity and sexual harassment climate on sexual harassment. These findings indicate that harassment is less prevalent and established antecedents are less impactful when greater value is perceived to be placed on fairness. Moreover, the attenuating effects of justice climate appear interchangeable with those of harassment climate or sex similarity, suggesting that managing justice climate effectively generally helps to deter sexual harassment.</jats:p>",2018

However, societal role expectations for both women and leaders have changed in the decades since the last empirical review of the gender gap in leader emergence (Eagly &amp; Karau, 1991). We leverage meta‐analytic evidence to demonstrate that the gender gap has decreased over time, but a contemporary gap remains. To understand why this gap in leader emergence occurs, we draw on social role theory to develop a Gender‐Agency/Communion‐Participation (GAP) Model—an integrative theoretical model that includes both trait and behavioral mechanisms. Specifically, we examine a sequence of effects: from gender to agentic and communal personality traits, from these traits to behavioral participation in group activities, and ultimately from participation to leader emergence. The model is tested using original meta‐analyses of the personality and behavioral mechanisms (coding 1,632 effect sizes total). Gender differences in leadership emergence are predominately explained by agentic traits (positive) and communal traits (negative), both directly and through the mechanism of participation in group discussions. In addition, several paths in the theoretical model are moderated by situational contingencies. Our study enhances knowledge of the mechanisms and boundary conditions underlying the gender gap in leader emergence.</jats:p>",2018

Yet little is known about how perceptions of being mistrusted by coworkers may affect employees’ subsequent daily attitudes and behaviors. Indeed, the existing literature on mistrust has overwhelmingly focused on how mistrust affects the trustor (person whose trust is violated) but not the trustee (the mistrusted person). This is problematic because conservation of resources theory (COR) suggests that perceived mistrust is a negative experience likely to affect the mistrusted employees’ subsequent attitudes and behaviors both at work and at home. To investigate this possibility, we conducted an experience sampling study of employees and their significant others over 3 consecutive workweeks. Consistent with COR, day by day perceptions of mistrust increased employees’ emotional exhaustion, consequently leading to withdrawal from colleagues at work and conflict toward their significant other at home. Moreover, supporting self‐enhancement (rather than self‐verification) theory, these effects were stronger when employees perceived mistrust to be high (vs. low) in justification. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this research.</jats:p>",2018

However, a more complete understanding of leaders’ ingratiation requires recognition that leaders have multiple audiences and that there may be negative unintended consequences of this behavior to at least one of these audiences. Specifically, upward ingratiation may reduce subordinates’ willingness to contribute to the organization through effective performance because it diminishes relationship quality between leaders and subordinates. To explore this issue, we develop and test a multilevel model that contrasts effects of leaders’ upward ingratiation on leader‐ and subordinate‐level outcomes through the quality of social exchange in the corresponding relationship. We test our predictions by conducting a multiwave, multisource field study with a sample of 91 leaders, 91 bosses, and 215 subordinates in South Korea. Our findings reveal that upward ingratiation is positively associated with indicators of leaders’ intrinsic and extrinsic success because it enhances leader–boss exchange quality (LLX). In contrast, leaders’ upward ingratiation negatively influences subordinates’ job performance because it diminishes leader–subordinate exchange quality (LMX). We also find that subordinates’ perceptions of leaders’ political skill mitigate the negative indirect relationship between upward ingratiation and subordinates’ job performance via LMX quality, and that our hypotheses apply to ingratiation but not to other forms of impression management. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings in relation to ingratiation specifically and to impression management more generally.</jats:p>",2018

Yet, there remains debate about whether the influence of increasingly benevolent leadership on follower outcomes is linearly favorable. Grounded in the too‐much‐of‐a‐good‐thing effect and resource allocation theory, we developed and tested a model considering a potential curvilinear relationship between benevolent leadership and team performance while also examining the mediating role of team action processes. We further reasoned that this curvilinear indirect effect would be moderated by team commitment, which could neutralize the diminishing performance returns resulting from excessive benevolent leadership. To test these ideas, we carried out two studies. In the first study, multisource and time‐lagged data collected from 381 employees working in 104 research and development teams showed that benevolent leadership exhibited an inverted U‐shaped relationship with team performance, but this curvilinear relationship disappeared in teams with high team commitment. In the second study, we replicated and extended our results using a sample of 417 employees from 101 hotel management teams of a large hotel chain. Specifically, we found an inverted U‐shaped relationship between benevolent leadership and team action processes, which mediated the inverted U‐shaped relationship between benevolent leadership and team performance. Moreover, this indirect curvilinear effect only held in teams with low team commitment. We discuss the implications of our findings for both theory and practice.</jats:p>",2018

Due to this trait characterization, the literature has largely reached a consensus that trust propensity is only an important base of trust in the earliest stage of a relationship—before information on trustworthiness has been gathered. Additionally, the trait conceptualization of trust propensity inhibits it from being modeled as an explanatory mechanism. Drawing on accessibility theory, a theory of trait activation, we argue that trust propensity has state‐like characteristics that are “activated” by the daily treatment an employee receives from coworkers. Our model highlights that the social context—predominantly ignored in prior trust research because of its lack of relevance to dyadic perceptions of trustworthiness—can have a substantial impact on dyadic trust. Across two multisource experience sampling methodology studies, we provide evidence that state trust propensity transmits the effects of citizenship and deviance received to trust in a focal coworker, whether that focal coworker is a source of that treatment or not. We also address how general levels of workplace unfairness—a between‐person construct—influence these dynamics. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these within‐person dynamics for fostering trust within organizations.</jats:p>",2018

It was assumed that narrative comments would reflect true performance variance that overlaps with traditional ratings, but also that they would capture incremental variance due to increases in total information and a reduction in rater‐motivated biases in contexts in which narrative data were not explicitly linked to administrative outcomes. The derived narrative scores were reliable across years, converged with traditional numerical ratings and explained incremental variance in future performance outcomes (performance ratings, involuntary turnover, promotions, and pay increases). Collectively, this study highlights how narratives can enhance performance measurement and demonstrates how these data can be economically scored in applied settings.</jats:p>",2018

Tipping can be used as an incentive mechanism to reduce a principal–agent problem. An agency problem occurs when the interests of a principal and agent are misaligned, and it is challenging for the principal to monitor or control the activities of the agent. However, past research has been limited in the investigation of the extent to which tipping is effective at addressing this problem. Following an examination of 74 independent studies with 12,271 individuals, meta‐analytic results indicate that there is a small, positive relation between service quality and percentage of a bill tipped (<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""graphic/peps12261-math-0001.png"" xlink:title=""urn:x-wiley:00315826:media:peps12261:peps12261-math-0001"" /> = .15 without outliers). Yet, in support of the idea behind tipping, relative weights analyses illustrate that service quality was a stronger predictor of percentage of the bill tipped than food quality, frequency of patronage, and dining party size. Evidence also suggests that racial minority servers tend to be tipped less than White servers (Cohen's <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> = .17), and women tend to be tipped more than men (Cohen's <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> = .15).

Our results further show that the relationship between narcissism and abusive supervision diminishes for those who are strong in terms of political skill. In addition, neurological executive control moderates the relationship between political skill and abusive behavior. When connectivity in executive control regions of the brain is lower, political skill becomes a more important factor in reducing the display of abusive behavior.

This article contributes to the literature on bottom‐up processes by detailing a statistical approach—the consensus emergence model (CEM)—that allows researchers to study emergence of shared perceptions and feelings or climates in groups over time. The described methodological approach extends standard multilevel methodology by examining residual variances within a growth model to account for dynamic change in group consensus. The CEM provides a formal test for consensus emergence. The approach also allows researchers to test explanatory models of consensus emergence by including person‐level, group‐level, and observation‐level predictors. We illustrate the CEM by applying the method to data from two longitudinal studies of work units. The first study investigated job satisfaction in military companies. Our second study examined professional archeologists working in groups on a field excavation mission and focused on fatigue at the end of the work day. Our analyses demonstrate the CEM's ability to detect and study emergence, and suggest that the CEM may be a valuable tool to help extend the study of emergence in organizational research.</jats:p>",2018

Mediation tests indicated that workplace discrimination is associated with employee outcomes through both job stress and justice. Moderator analyses showed that discrimination appears to be most detrimental when it is observed rather than personally experienced, interpersonal rather than formal, and measured broadly rather than specifically. We also found that discrimination–outcome relationships differ across work and nonwork contexts and as a function of the social identity targeted by discrimination. Discrimination generally explained meaningful incremental variance in outcomes after controlling for the effects of negative affectivity, but the relationships between discrimination and health were substantially decreased.

Importantly, these two functions co‐exist and interact to influence supervisors’ justice behavior and the consistency of such behavior via supervisors’ justification for unjust behavior. Findings from a set of experimental and correlational studies confirmed these predictions. The positive effects of supervisors’ value‐expressive function on justice behavior and its consistency were stronger when their instrumental function was lower (vs. higher), and justification for unjust behavior mediated these effects.

Our overarching goal is to understand why some employees comply and others champion change efforts. We examine the combined effects of context and person factors on both positive and negative employee reactions to change, and then investigate the differential effects of these reactions on employee support for change. Results support our hypotheses and show that change management support (context factor) negatively predicts threat appraisals and positively predicts challenge appraisals. Both compliance and championing are positively predicted by challenge appraisals, and threat appraisals are negatively related to championing. Analyses also reveal that the positive relationship between change management support and challenge appraisal is stronger when dispositional resistance to change (person factor) is high. Moderated‐mediation analyses suggest employees’ compliance and championing for change are differentially affected by management actions, their own dispositional resistance, and that these effects are mediated through positive and negative appraisals.</jats:p>",2017

In addition, recent empirical work has focused on how OCB is an intraindividual phenomenon, such that employees vary daily in the extent to which they help others. However, one limitation of this research has been an overemphasis on well‐being consequences associated with daily helping (e.g., changes in affect and mental depletion) and far less attention on behavioral outcomes. In this study, we develop a self‐regulatory framework that articulates how helping others at work is a depleting experience that can lead to a reduction in subsequent acts of helping others, and an increase in behaviors aimed at helping oneself (i.e., engaging in political acts). We further theorize how two individual differences—prevention focus and political skill—serve as cross‐level moderators of these relations. In an experience sampling study of 91 full‐time employees across 10 consecutive workdays, our results illustrate that helping is a depleting act that makes individuals more likely to engage in self‐serving acts and less likely to help others. Moreover, the relation of helping acts with depletion is strengthened for employees who have higher levels of prevention focus.</jats:p>",2017

Specifically, we predicted that psychological empowerment would moderate the relationship between prior accident involvement and outcomes. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of 392 employees and their 66 supervisors working in an iron and steel manufacturing firm in Southern Turkey, using data collected from employees and their supervisors via four separate surveys. Results suggest that accident involvement was positively related to supervisor‐rated employee withdrawal, production deviance, and sabotage only when psychological empowerment was low. The results illustrate that workplace accidents have indirect costs in the form of higher withdrawal and maladaptive behaviors, and organizations may inoculate employees against some of these outcomes via higher psychological empowerment.</jats:p>",2017

To provide this assessment, we employed a three‐step approach. First, we conducted a comprehensive meta‐analysis of turnover predictors, updating existing effect sizes and examining multiple new antecedents. Second, guided by theory, we developed and tested a set of substantive moderators, considering factors that might exacerbate or mitigate zero‐order meta‐analytic effects. Third, we examined the holistic pattern of results in order to highlight the most pressing needs for future turnover research. The results of Step 1 reveal multiple newer predictors and updated effect sizes of more traditional predictors, which have received substantially greater study. The results of Step 2 provide insight into the context‐dependent nature of many antecedent–turnover relationships. In Step 3, our discussion takes a bird's‐eye view of the turnover “forest” and considers the theoretical and practical implications of the results. We offer several research recommendations that break from the traditional turnover paradigm, as a means of guiding future study.</jats:p>",2017

In addition, the study examined the moderating roles of daily task significance, daily family interference with work, and commuting means efficacy in this mediation model. Results from 45 bus commuters’ daily diary data over a period of 15 workdays indicated that the amount of morning commuting stressors experienced by the bus commuters was positively related to their morning commuting strain, which, in turn, had a negative impact on self‐regulation at work. At the within‐person level, daily task significance buffered the negative indirect relationship between morning commuting stressors and self‐regulation at work via morning commuting strain, whereas daily family interference with work in the morning exacerbated this negative indirect relationship. Further, at the between‐person level, commuting means efficacy buffered this negative indirect relationship such that the negative indirect effect was weaker for workers with higher (vs. lower) commuting means efficacy. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</jats:p>",2017

We conducted 2 studies that evaluated the observability of CWB items and consequences of observability. First, we show that many CWBs are unlikely to be witnessed by supervisors or coworkers—specifically, behaviors such as “spends too much time fantasizing or daydreaming instead of working” and “discussed confidential company information with an unauthorized person” were found to be lowest in observability, whereas “cursed at someone at work” or “acted rudely toward someone at work” were relatively higher in observability (though observability was generally low). Second, a meta‐analysis revealed variability in item‐level relationships (correlations and mean differences) between self‐ratings and observer ratings for specific CWB scale items (i.e., items from Bennett &amp; Robinson, 2,000). Important, this variability was partially explained by observability—behaviors with low self–observer convergence tend to have low levels of observability, whereas behaviors with higher levels of convergence tend to have higher levels of observability. This study demonstrates that supervisor and coworker ratings of CWB may be susceptible to an observability bias resulting from rating behaviors they have not likely witnessed.</jats:p>",2017

Although some evidence suggests that employees engage in dysfunctional workplace behaviors as a result of mistreatment, others studies have suggested that employees may cope with such negative experiences by helping others. Drawing on negative state relief theory, we conducted 2 studies to test these relationships and examine whether service employees cope with negative emotions arising from such daily customer mistreatment by engaging in helping others. In Study 1, daily surveys from 70 restaurant employees showed that daily customer mistreatment predicted the experience of negative moods the next morning, which, in turn, led to higher levels of coworker helping the next day. In Study 2, daily surveys from 54 retail employees showed that daily customer mistreatment led to higher customer helping the next day, but only when customer orientation was high. Our results further show that helping behavior was associated with elevated positive affective experiences and that the proposed relationships differ depending on whether customer mistreatment is measured at a daily or a cumulative perspective. Specifically, cumulative customer mistreatment over time decreased general helping. These findings are discussed in relation to employees' coping strategies towards acute and cumulative mistreatment.</jats:p>",2016

Using survey data from working professionals and executives pursuing a Master of Business Administration degree, we found that, as expected, those respondents who were both married and had children reported higher levels of family role identification relative to other respondents. Also, we found evidence of an indirect effect of family structure on leadership behaviors such that being married with children was indirectly associated with higher supervisor ratings of the respondents’ leadership behaviors via family role identification and the transfer of resources from the family role to the work role. Further, this indirect effect was stronger for women than for men. Contrary to traditional expectations, and consistent with enrichment theorizing, our findings suggest that investment in the family role can enhance employees’ display of valuable leadership behaviors in the workplace.</jats:p>",2016

However, relative weight analyses reveal a highly dominant variable within each category (personal initiative, felt responsibility, engagement, leader–member exchange, and positive workplace climate). We also find that undifferentiated constructive voice has a moderate zero‐order association with job performance that is nonsignificant when task performance and organizational citizenship behavior are also considered. Finally, we explore how associations vary as a function of whether voice is promotive or prohibitive. First, there are significant differences in associations with over a third of the antecedents (core self‐evaluations, felt responsibility, organizational commitment, detachment, psychological safety, ethical leadership, and leader openness). Second, although promotive voice has a positive association with job performance, the opposite is true for prohibitive voice. We conclude with suggestions to enhance our understanding of voice, especially with respect to efforts needed to clarify and distinguish promotive and prohibitive voice.</jats:p>",2016

Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the interactive relationship between job demands, control, and death.

We tested our hypothesis using a 7‐year time‐lagged design in a sample of 2,363 individuals from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. Our results supported our hypothesis, with results showing that for individuals in low control jobs, high job demands are associated with a 15.4% increase in the odds of death compared to low job demands. For those in high control jobs, high job demands are associated with a 34% decrease in the odds of death compared to low job demands. Supplementary analyses revealed a similar pattern predicting body mass index in the group of surviving individuals. We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and practice, while proposing several avenues for future research.</jats:p>",2016

In a large managerial sample (Study 1: <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> ∼ 12,500), we found that ineffective interpersonal behaviors were slightly less frequent among female managers but slightly more damaging to women than men when present. Evidence of bias was not found in performance evaluations but emerged when leaders were asked about derailment potential in the future. We replicated this pattern of effects in a second large managerial sample (Study 2: <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> ∼ 35,500) and in two experimental studies (Studies 3 and 4) in which gender and interpersonal behaviors were manipulated. In Study 4, we also showed that when supervisors believe that a manager might derail in the future, they tend to withdraw mentoring support and sponsorship, which are especially critical for women's career advancement. Our research highlights the importance of leaders’ perceptions of derailment potential—which differ from evaluations of performance or promotability—both because they appear to be subject to stereotype‐based gender bias and because they have important implications for the mentoring and sponsorship that male and female managers receive.</jats:p>",2016

In order to address these questions, we aggregate theoretical and empirical works, and draw on 136 independent samples representing over 22,000 individuals and nearly 5,000 groups, to conduct a comprehensive meta‐analysis on the antecedents and outcomes of psychological safety. We not only present the nomological network of psychological safety but also extend this research in 4 important ways. First, we compare effect sizes to determine the relative effectiveness of antecedents to psychological safety. Second, we examine the extent to which psychological safety influences both task performance and organizational citizenship behaviors over and beyond related concepts such as positive leader relations and work engagement. Third, we examine whether research design characteristics and national culture alter validities within the nomological network, thus promoting a more accurate and contextualized understanding of psychological safety. Finally, we test the homology assumption by comparing the effect sizes of the antecedents and outcomes of psychological safety across individual and group levels of analysis. We conclude with a discussion of the areas in need of future examination.</jats:p>",2016

Newcomers learn and assimilate effectively not only when they have vertical connections to high‐status organization members but also when they can compensate for their lack of high‐status connections by leveraging their strong horizontal ties with peers and favorable core self‐evaluations.

Utilizing multi‐level modeling analysis techniques and data from a sample of 625 employees from 12 different organizations in Israel, we tested the proposed relationship as mediated by employee engagement and moderated by sector of employment (business versus public). Results were generally consistent with the hypothesized conceptual model in that we found the indirect relationship between learning climate and employees’ creativity and adaptivity to be mediated by employee engagement. In addition, we found that this mediation through engagement is moderated by sector of employment. We conclude that the relationship between learning climate and employee performance behaviors is more complex than previously argued in the learning climate literature.

Despite its widespread use, especially for recruiting informants for multisource research, virtually no published research has addressed possible biases snowball sampling may cause in findings of this type of research. Such potential biases were tested empirically in a multisource study with a sample of 1,058 employed students asked to collect online ratings from their supervisors and coworkers. Informant ratings were obtained for 358 target participants. Objective indicators were employed to identify informant ratings suspicious of being fabricated. Results indicated that target participants who report (a) better relationship quality with informants, (b) fewer organizational constraints, and (c) more favorable self‐evaluations on behaviors to be rated by informants were more likely to be included in multisource data unsuspicious of being fabricated. Inclusion of informant ratings suspicious of being fabricated led to inflated estimates of self‐other consensus and of variance accounted for in criterion measures, to deflated informant rating means, but also to a target sample less restricted in terms of relevant organizational variables. In sum, the present findings suggest that potential biases should be identified in future uses of snowball sampling. Some practical recommendations toward that end are derived.</jats:p>",2016

Specifically, we examine the interactive effect of employees’ unethical behaviors and job performance onto relationship conflict, and whether such conflict eventuates in workplace ostracism. Although employees’ unethical behaviors typically go against moral norms, high job performance may provide a motivated reason to ignore moral violations. In this regard, we predict that job performance will mitigate the relationship between employee unethical behavior and workplace ostracism, as mediated by relationship conflict.

This study investigates within‐person variability in mastery goal orientation together with variability over time in the application of newly acquired knowledge and skills to the job context. Data from longitudinal surveys of trainees voluntarily attending statistical workshops revealed that trainees varied significantly in 2 characteristics of transfer trajectory: (a) initial attempts to transfer and (b) subsequent rate of change in transfer. Two affective learning outcomes showed differential relationships with transfer trajectories: Whereas posttraining self‐efficacy predicted initial attempt of transfer, motivation to transfer assessed at the end of training predicted subsequent rate of change in transfer. Furthermore, level and variability of trainees’ mastery orientation interacted to influence posttraining self‐efficacy and motivation to transfer, and subsequently transfer trajectories. Specifically, a trainee's mastery orientation level had stronger prediction of these outcomes when his/her mastery orientation distribution was less variable across situations. These findings highlight the importance of attending to within‐person variability in the study of training transfer by (a) considering training transfer as trajectories over time and (b) understanding trainee traits as frequency distributions.</jats:p>",2016

Across two field studies, our findings show that the relationship between transformational leadership and subordinate affective organizational commitment is less positive when status incongruence is high. Furthermore, in both field studies we found a 3‐way interaction among transformational leadership, status incongruence, and supervisor gender predicting subordinate affective organizational commitment. Specifically, in Study 1 (pink‐collar employees in Turkey), low status incongruence strengthened the positive relationship between transformational leadership and subordinate affective organizational commitment for male leaders. In Study 2 (pink‐collar employees in the United States), low status incongruence strengthened the positive relationship between transformational leadership and subordinate affective organizational commitment for female leaders. Furthermore, Study 2 also revealed that collective identity was a mediator of both the significant 2‐ and 3‐way interaction effects on subordinate affective organizational commitment.</jats:p>",2016

Second, limited work using identity theory has been done in the human resource management (HRM) domain. The purpose of our research is to serve as a catalyst for future work by identifying 5 work‐relevant role‐based identities and creating a parsimonious measure for each. These metrics were tested, and initial evidence of their validity is provided using 6 independent samples.

The results show that surface acting in customer service encounters is positively, and deep acting is negatively, related to ego depletion. Employees’ ego depletion, in turn, is positively associated with their interpersonally harmful behavior toward coworkers. Hence, ego depletion appears as a mediating variable that translates the implications of distinct emotional labor strategies into coworker harming. Moreover, emotion regulation self‐efficacy moderates the role of surface acting. The positive indirect relationship between surface acting and coworker harming, via ego depletion, is buffered among employees with higher emotion regulation self‐efficacy. These findings shed new light on the complex and far‐reaching consequences of emotional labor. We demonstrate the relevance of emotional labor to third parties not directly involved in customer service encounters and highlight important mediators and boundary conditions of these indirect relations.</jats:p>",2016

We hypothesized that a manager's exposure to 3 types of developmental experiences (formal development programs, developmental job challenges, and developmental supervision) would positively relate to supervisor's assessment of the manager's leadership effectiveness in the current job role and promotability within the organization through the manager's leadership self‐efficacy and size and quality of the manager's mentor network. Results based on a sample of 235 retail managers showed that leadership self‐efficacy and mentor network fully mediated the relationship between job challenges and promotability, whereas leadership self‐efficacy also fully mediated the relationship between job challenges and leadership effectiveness. Developmental supervision was indirectly related to promotability through mentor network. In addition, a 3‐way interaction analysis revealed that participation in formal development activities had a positive indirect relationship with leadership effectiveness and promotability mediated by leadership self‐efficacy when a manager experienced either lower levels of job challenge and developmental supervision, or higher levels of both. Our findings contribute to leadership knowledge by examining how both formal and informal developmental experiences relate to leadership effectiveness and promotability through social processes.</jats:p>",2016

This paper uses a dynamic, computational model of performance‐as‐results to examine possible sources of such distributions. That is, building off the classic model of job performance (Campbell &amp; Pritchard, 1976), components of a dynamic model are examined in 4 separate experiments using Monte Carlo simulations. The experiments indicate that positively skewed distributions can arise from pure luck, multiplicative combinations of factors where 1 of those factors has a zero origin, Matthew effects associated with learning, and feedback effects of performance on resource allocation policies by external agents. The results are discussed in terms of explanations for positively skewed performance distributions and the use and expansion of the computational model for examining dynamic performance more generally.</jats:p>",2016

Integrating relational mentoring with relational systems theory, we first examined whether the presence of a high‐quality mentoring relationship buffers employees in a sample of 3,813 workers. In support of the “mentors‐as‐buffers” hypothesis, we found that employees who witnessed or were aware of racial discrimination at work had lower organizational commitment than those not exposed, but employees with high‐quality mentoring relationships experienced less loss of commitment than those lacking mentors. We then examined the specific buffering behaviors used by mentors in high‐quality relationships and whether these behaviors were effective for other work relationships and outcomes. Applying Kahn's typology, we developed and validated a measure of high‐quality relational holding behaviors in a sample of 262 workers. Using this measure in a third sample of 557 workers, we found that mentors buffer by providing holding behaviors, but we did not find this buffering effect when supervisors or coworkers provided holding behaviors. This potent mentor buffering effect held across a range of outcomes, including organizational commitment, physical symptoms of stress, insomnia, and stress‐related absenteeism. These studies suggest that mentoring may be a singularly effective relationship that offers a safe harbor for employees faced with ambient discrimination at work.</jats:p>",2016

A Meta‐Analytic Investigation Based on Upper Echelons Theory,180,4,305,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12140,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>What roles do CEOs play in firm performance? To address this question, the management field has accumulated a substantial amount of research over the past 3 decades built on upper echelons theory (UET), which posits that CEO characteristics manifest in firm strategic actions and, in this way, future firm performance. Hence, there is a need to systematically amass and take stock of prior empirical findings for UET testing and development. We use meta‐analytic techniques to synthesize prior UET research on the relationships among commonly studied CEO characteristics, firm strategic actions, and future firm performance. Based on 308 studies, meta‐analytic results generally support UET's predictions with a few exceptions: CEO characteristics (i.e., tenure, formal education, prior career experience, and positive self‐concept) are significantly associated with firm strategic actions, which in turn are significantly related to future firm performance. Moreover, CEO characteristics (i.e., age, tenure, formal education, and prior career experience) are positively related to future firm performance. In addition, fine‐grained analyses have revealed interesting and important relationships between specific measures of CEO characteristics (e.g., CEO prior task experience) and firm outcomes (e.g., firm strategic actions that match with CEO prior task experience). Implications for theory, future research, and practice are discussed.</jats:p>",2016

We describe the conceptual differences among these approaches and hypothesize how they operate differently in predicting work and family attitudes and performance. Relative weights analyses showed that additive spillover was the most important predictor of work attitudes (organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and turnover intent), followed by balance satisfaction and effectiveness. However, balance satisfaction and effectiveness together were the most important predictors of family satisfaction and job and family performance. Mediation tests revealed that unique and interactive effects of bidirectional conflict and enrichment related to work and family attitudes and performance indirectly through balance satisfaction and effectiveness. We discuss implications of these findings and offer suggestions to guide future research and theory on work‐family balance.</jats:p>",2016
10.1111/peps.12143,Boundaryless LMX: Examining LMX's Impact on External Career Outcomes and Alumni Goodwill,90,4,28,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12143,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>Research has convincingly shown that leader–member exchange (LMX) is associated with a range of beneficial outcomes for employees within organizations. As employees increasingly pursue boundaryless careers that straddle multiple organizations, it is important to ask: Do advantages from LMX extend beyond the current organization and persist even after employees have left it? We propose that employees in higher quality LMX relationships with their managers benefit from stronger professional development, which can pay off in the form of better career outcomes on the external job market. Further, after leaving, whether or not ex‐employees (i.e., alumni) harbor goodwill toward their former organizations is likely to depend on their LMX quality prior to leaving. Alumni goodwill matters because organizations can potentially reap important strategic benefits from their alumni. Using time separated data including alumni interviews conducted by third‐party consultants, we find that, among employees who quit, pre‐turnover LMX is positively related to higher salaries and greater responsibility in their next jobs and is also positively related to alumni goodwill. Moreover, the strength of the LMX–alumni goodwill relationship depends on whether managers made robust retention efforts after employees communicated their decisions to quit.</jats:p>",2016

University students who were enrolled in an international exchange program with partners worldwide participated in this study. Using a 3‐wave time‐lagged design, we found that implicit culture beliefs (the beliefs about fixedness or malleability of cultural attributes) influenced intercultural rejection sensitivity, which impacted the cross‐cultural adjustment of sojourning students and their subsequent CQ. Specifically, we found that cross‐cultural adjustment experiences, particularly in the social domain, play an important role in influencing CQ.

Given the potential costs associated with voluntary turnover, this study sought to clarify the roles of networking behaviors in relation to voluntary turnover by focusing on the distinction between internal and external networking. Based on survey responses of industrial and organizational psychology professionals, we found that internal and external networking behaviors differentially predicted decisions to voluntarily leave employers 2 years later: The likelihood of voluntary turnover was negatively predicted by internal networking and positively predicted by external networking. Furthermore, to shed light on the reasons why employee networking behaviors differentially predicted turnover decisions, this study also examined 4 turnover antecedents (job satisfaction, job embeddedness, perceived employment opportunities, and job offers) as potential mediating mechanisms. Results revealed that the relationships of internal and external networking with voluntary turnover were mediated by job embeddedness and job offers, respectively. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding and managing employee networking and retention.</jats:p>",2016

In the case of three of the articles, any errors or omissions were either reconciled or determined not to significantly affect the articles’ findings or conclusions. In the case of the two articles listed above, published online on 22 August 2011 in Wiley Online Library, and in Volume 64, pp. 739–770 and 771–802, respectively, the journal concluded that there may be errors in some of the reported fit statistics, but it is difficult to understand the nature of the potential errors and their implications unless the raw data is made available. Unfortunately, the journal was not provided with the raw data, despite repeated requests to the authors. In the case of the second article (Hannah et al., 2011), a governmental agency confirmed that they collected the data and controlled its storage, but no longer maintained the data after five years and thus could not make it available.

Drawing on literatures concerning social norms and pluralistic ignorance, this study examines the role of personal preference, group norm misalignment, and misperception of group norms on employees’ utilization of family‐friendly benefits. In 2 samples (154 firefighters and 440 nurses) across 3 data collection periods, we found that when employees’ preferences for benefit utilization were misaligned with the perceived group norm, they adjusted their family‐friendly benefit utilization in a manner congruent with the norm, even when that norm was misperceived. Further, we found that family‐friendly benefit utilization was negatively associated with work–family conflict. Together, our findings suggest that misperceived social norms regarding family‐friendly benefit utilization can lead to situations whereby employees do not utilize family‐friendly benefits because they mistakenly perceive utilization is not socially accepted and, as a result, experience higher work–family conflict.</jats:p>",2016

A Multilevel Model Linking Managerial Coaching Skill and Frequency to Sales Goal Attainment,82,4,63,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12123,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>Managerial coaching is a process of feedback provision, behavioral modeling, and goal setting with subordinates to improve their performance and address their personal challenges. Despite the popularity of coaching as a management practice, the impact of coaching on objective measures of performance remains unclear. To this end, we tested a multilevel model linking managerial coaching frequency and skill to the sales goal attainment of 1,246 sales representatives in 136 teams within a pharmaceuticals organization over a year. Managers’ coaching skill, which was evaluated in the context of a training exercise, was directly related to the annual sales goal attainment of the sales representatives that they supervised. This effect was partially mediated by team‐level role clarity, as predicted by feedback intervention theory and goal setting theory. In addition, coaching skill had a cross‐level moderating effect on the relationship between coaching frequency and sales goal attainment; coaching frequency had a negative effect on goal attainment when coaching skill was low. We discuss the implications of this finding for coaching research and practice. Overall, our results demonstrate the clear theoretical and practical importance of effective managerial coaching by drawing on multisource and multilevel measurements with a predictive design.</jats:p>",2015

We further present detailed steps to incorporate the Case V method into Schmidt and Hunter's (2015) psychometric meta‐analysis methods (both individual correction and artifact distribution approaches). We then evaluate the accuracy of the Case V method vis‐à‐vis existing methods. Monte‐Carlo simulation results indicate that the Case V method provides very accurate estimates for the mean true score correlation and reasonably accurate estimates for the true standard deviation. More important, Case V almost always provides more accurate results than alternative methods (particularly, Case IV). To illustrate how the Case V method works with real data, we conduct a reanalysis of Judge, Heller, and Mount's (2002) meta‐analysis examining the relationships between the Big 5 personality traits and job satisfaction. Results indicate that the true score correlations between the Big 5 traits and job satisfaction have been underestimated, whereas their true standard deviations have been overestimated.

In this paper, we develop theory to explain how stable versus shifting change‐supportive perceptions over time differentially influence the perceived momentum associated with goal‐directed change (i.e., change‐based momentum). We use cross‐level polynomial regression and data obtained early and 1 year later within an organization implementing a lean manufacturing transformation to model changes in individual perceptions. Results suggest that momentum perceptions are higher for “Champions” (stable and high perceptions over time) as compared to “Converts” (increasing perceptions over time), but momentum perceptions are lower for “Defectors” (decreasing perceptions over time) as compared to “Doubters” (stable and low perceptions over time). We find that even if participants converge upon change‐supportive perceptions later in the change process, early divergent perceptions influence subsequent momentum for the change. These findings highlight the important role of temporal shifts in perceptions for organizational change processes.</jats:p>",2015
10.1111/peps.12117,Embedding Employees Early On: The Importance of Workplace Respect,117,1,38,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12117,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>This study examines workplace respect as an important condition that promotes increases in perceived organizational embeddedness (POE). I especially focus on young, educated employees’ perceptions of organizational embeddedness, as these employees strongly desire being respected and valued. Guided by social exchange theory, I propose that increases in perceived respect promote increases in gratitude toward the organization, which in turn promote increases in POE over time. Increases in POE are in turn related to lower turnover. Data collected from a young, college‐graduate sample (average age = 25) at five points over an 18‐month period demonstrated that (a) within‐person increases in perceived respect were associated with within‐person increases in gratitude over 12 months, (b) within‐person increases in gratitude were associated with within‐person increases in POE over 12 months, and (c) employees who reported greater increases in POE over 12 months were less likely to leave their organizations 6 months afterward. In summary, this study illustrates that even workers in the early stages of their careers can feel increasingly embedded in their organizations when they feel increasingly respected by their colleagues.</jats:p>",2015
10.1111/peps.12109,Are Workplace Friendships a Mixed Blessing? Exploring Tradeoffs of Multiplex Relationships and their Associations with Job Performance,169,4,183,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12109,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>Theory and research note the ubiquity of multiplex workplace friendships—multifaceted relationships that superimpose friendship with work‐focused interactions—but it is unclear how they compel or hinder job performance. In a study of insurance company employees (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 168), we found that the number of multiplex workplace friendships in one's social network is positively associated with supervisor ratings of job performance. However, we also found that there is a negative indirect effect on job performance through emotional exhaustion, which is offset, in part, through enhanced positive affect. Results of a second study of restaurant and retail sales employees (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 182) provide greater insight into the positive and negative effects of multiplex workplace friendships. Specifically, these relationships enhanced job performance through trust but detracted from job performance through maintenance difficulty. Collectively, our results illustrate that having a large number of multiplex friendships at work is a mixed blessing. Although the provision and restoration of resources fostered by multiplex relationships benefits employee job performance, these benefits are muted somewhat by the personal resources they deplete.</jats:p>",2015
10.1111/peps.12110,When and How Does LMX Differentiation Influence Followers’ Work Outcomes? The Interactive Roles of One's own LMX Status and Organizational Context,92,1,41,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12110,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>The fundamental premise of the leader–member exchange (LMX) theory is that leaders’ relationships with their followers vary in quality. Although LMX differentiation (i.e., within‐group variation in the quality of LMX) is generally considered a sound leadership practice, its effects on group members’ work outcomes remain poorly understood. Drawing on LMX and upper echelons theories, this study suggests that employees’ reactions to LMX differentiation depend on the personal LMX status of employees and the characteristics of the organizational context. Analyses of multilevel data collected from 502 employees organized into 135 work groups in 34 firms show that the impact of LMX differentiation on work outcomes is more positive (or less negative) for employees with lower rather than higher LMX. The findings highlight the importance of organizational boundary conditions for these interactions: The negative moderation by one's own LMX status is stronger when top managers decentralize responsibilities to lower hierarchical levels and weaker when top managers impose a shared vision to guide the organization.</jats:p>",2015

Research has generally not found support for a linear (i.e., main effect) relationship between LMX differentiation and team performance; rather, moderators typically determine whether the relationship is significantly positive or negative. Examining linear effect moderators alone, however, does not account for (a) potential curvilinear (i.e., inverted U‐shaped) effects, (b) explanatory mechanisms of how LMX differentiation influences team performance, or (c) moderators of curvilinear effects. Integrating social identity theory with LMX differentiation research, we propose inverted U‐shaped relationships between LMX differentiation and both team coordination (as a mediator) and team performance (as an outcome), and we examine both team size and team power distance orientation as moderators. Using data from 928 employees in 145 teams in 3 organizations, we found an inverted U‐shaped relationship between LMX differentiation and team coordination, which, in turn, partially mediated LMX differentiation's inverted U‐shaped relationship with team performance. Larger teams, or those with higher team power distance orientation, benefit more from LMX differentiation. By integrating social identity theory with LMX differentiation research, we enhance the understanding of the processes by, and conditions under, which LMX differentiation affects team performance both positively and negatively.</jats:p>",2015
10.1111/peps.12114,Interpersonal Process of Emotional Labor: The Role of Negative and Positive Customer Treatment,64,3,73,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12114,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>Emotional labor refers to the process of regulating both feelings and expressions in response to the display rules for promoting organizational goals. Existing literature has provided strong evidence for the impact of emotional labor (i.e., surface acting and deep acting) on service employees’ emotional exhaustion. However, the empirical examination of the mechanisms underlying this association is largely missing from prior research. Drawing on the social interaction model of emotion regulation, this article reported 2 daily diary studies examining the role of customer treatment toward employees in channeling emotional labor's impact on employee emotional well‐being. Specifically, Study 1 measured emotional labor at the between‐person level as habitual emotional regulation strategies used by service employees, and Study 2 measured emotional labor at the within‐person level to capture its fluctuations. Results showed that employees engaging in more surface acting were more likely to receive negative treatment from customers, which in turn increased their negative affect and emotional exhaustion. Further, employees engaging in more deep acting were more likely to receive positive treatment from customers, which in turn increased their positive affect. Implications and limitations of these findings were discussed.</jats:p>",2015

An attitude‐based account suggests that value incongruence gives rise to negative attitudes toward organizations and thus causes low performance. To complement this mechanism, we propose a resource‐based account based on ego‐depletion theory, which suggests that value incongruence consumes an individual's regulatory resources and leads to low work performance. In support of this view, results from 2 survey studies and a vignette experiment reveal that value incongruence is positively associated with ego depletion, which in turn is negatively related to work performance. The mediation effect of ego depletion is independent of the attitude‐based mechanism as represented by job satisfaction and affective commitment. Consistent with the affective consistency perspective, the relationship between value incongruence and ego depletion is stronger among employees high in positive affectivity and weaker among employees high in negative affectivity. The corresponding moderated mediation analysis shows that the indirect effects of value incongruence on work performance through ego depletion vary as a function of positive and negative affectivity. This investigation unravels the self‐regulatory consequence of value incongruence and shows that the resource‐based mechanism of value incongruence operates differentially as a function of dispositional affectivity.</jats:p>",2015

Opposite Moderating Effects of General Self‐efficacy and Internal Locus of Control,98,3,131,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12104,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>Previous research is inconclusive about whether supervisor support always increases employee innovative behavior. To address this inconsistency, this research explores how and when supervisor support promotes innovative behavior by examining intrinsic motivation as a mediator and employee general self‐efficacy and internal locus of control as boundary conditions. Although these 2 positive self‐view variables are similar in terms of their positive effects on a variety of desirable work outcomes, we draw on self‐verification theory, which posits that self‐confirming information draws more attention, to reason that they exhibit opposite moderating effects on the influence of supervisor support. Based on 2 samples of employees in different industries and locations in China, this moderated mediated model was supported. General self‐efficacy showed an enhancement moderating effect, such that it amplified the mediated relationship between supervisor support and employee innovative behavior via intrinsic motivation. In contrast, internal locus of control showed a substitutional moderating effect, such that it weakened this mediated relationship. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</jats:p>",2015
10.1111/peps.12105,Transparency of Assessment Centers: Lower Criterion‐related Validity but Greater Opportunity to Perform?,74,4,28,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12105,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>Assessment centers (ACs) are popular selection devices in which assessees are assessed on several dimensions during different exercises. Surveys indicate that ACs vary with regard to the transparency of the targeted dimensions and that the number of transparent ACs has increased during recent years. Furthermore, research on this design feature has put conceptual arguments forward regarding the effects of transparency on criterion‐related validity, impression management, and fairness perceptions. This study is the first to examine these effects using supervisor‐rated job performance data as the criterion. We conducted simulated ACs with transparency as a between‐subjects factor. The sample consisted of part‐time employed participants who would soon be applying for a new job. In line with our hypothesis, results showed that ratings from an AC with nontransparent dimensions were more criterion valid than ratings from an AC with transparent dimensions. Concerning impression management, our results supported the hypothesis that transparency moderates the relationship between self‐promotion and job performance, such that self‐promotion in the nontransparent AC was more positively related to job performance than self‐promotion in the transparent AC. The data lent no support for the hypothesis that participants’ perceptions of their opportunity to perform are higher in the transparent AC.</jats:p>",2015
10.1111/peps.12103,A Critical Review and Best‐Practice Recommendations for Control Variable Usage,49,2,1098,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12103,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>The use of control variables plays a central role in organizational research due to practical difficulties associated with the implementation of experimental and quasi‐experimental designs. As such, we conducted an in‐depth review and content analysis of what variables, and why such variables are controlled for, in 10 of the most popular research domains (task performance, organizational citizenship behaviors, turnover, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, employee burnout, personality, leader‒member exchange, organizational justice, and affect) in organizational behavior/human resource management (OB/HRM) and applied psychology. Specifically, we examined 580 articles published from 2003 to 2012 in <jats:italic>AMJ</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>ASQ, JAP</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>JOM</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>PPsych</jats:italic>. Results indicate that, across research domains with clearly distinct theoretical bases, the overwhelming majority of the more than 3,500 controls identified in our review converge around the same simple demographic factors (i.e., gender, age, tenure), very little effort is made to explain why and how controls relate to focal variables of interest, and control variable practices have not changed much over the past decade. To address these results, we offer best‐practice recommendations in the form of a sequence of questions and subsequent steps that can be followed to make decisions on the appropriateness of including a specific control variable within a particular theoretical framework, research domain, and empirical study. Our recommendations can be used by authors as well as journal editors and reviewers to improve the transparency and appropriateness of practices regarding control variable usage.</jats:p>",2015

The results show a positive relationship between LMX and task performance (146 samples, ρ = .30) as well as citizenship performance (97 samples, ρ = .34), and negatively with counterproductive performance (19 samples, ρ = ‒.24). Of note, there was a positive relationship between LMX and objective task performance (20 samples, ρ = .24). Trust, motivation, empowerment, and job satisfaction mediated the relationship between LMX and task and citizenship performance with trust in the leader having the largest effect. There was no difference due to LMX measurement instrument (e.g., LMX7, LMX‐MDM). Overall, the relationship between LMX and performance was weaker when (a) measures were obtained from a different source or method and (b) LMX was measured by the follower than the leader (with common source‐ and method‐biased effects stronger for leader‐rated LMX quality). Finally, there was evidence for LMX leading to task performance but not for reverse or reciprocal directions of effects.</jats:p>",2015
10.1111/peps.12096,Cohen's <i>d</i> Corrected for Case IV Range Restriction: A More Accurate Procedure for Evaluating Subgroup Differences in Organizational Research,34,1,9,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12096,Personnel Psychology,"<jats:p>Organizational and staffing researchers are often interested in evaluating whether subgroup differences exist (e.g., between Caucasian and African‐American individuals) on predictors of job performance. To investigate subgroup differences, researchers often will collect data from current employees to make inferences about subgroup differences among job applicants. However, the magnitude of subgroup differences (i.e., Cohen's <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>) within incumbent samples may be different (i.e., smaller) than the magnitude of subgroup differences in applicant samples because selection of applicants typically reduces the variance of scores on the predictors (i.e., because lower scoring applicants are not selected). If researchers seek to generalize a <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> value in an incumbent sample to the applicant population, they may use Bobko, Roth, and Bobko's (correcting the effect size of <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> for range restriction and unreliability, 2001) Case II or III correction. By extension, Hunter, Schmidt, and Le (implications of direct and indirect range restriction for meta‐analysis methods and findings, 2006) have proposed a Case IV correction, which is more realistic than Bobko et al.'s approach. Therefore, this paper develops a Case IV correction for <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> (i.e., <jats:italic>d<jats:sub>c4</jats:sub></jats:italic>). The simulation results showed that the <jats:italic>d<jats:sub>c4</jats:sub></jats:italic> was generally accurate across 6,000 simulation conditions. Moreover, 2 published datasets were reanalyzed to show the influence of the Case IV correction on <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>.

More specifically, we examine justice–job offer acceptance relations relative to other pertinent recruitment predictors including, organizational image, familiarity, person–organization (P–O) fit perceptions, and recruiter behaviors. Findings from both studies support the importance of justice perceptions in influencing job offer acceptance. Fairness perceptions accounted for 29.37% and 19.22% of the unique variance in job offer acceptance, in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. The results of this research provide much needed empirical evidence to the scant literature on actual job acceptance and highlight important practical implications for employers.</jats:p>",2015

We conducted 4 studies with 273 bank employees and 197 university students designed to assess the extent to which executive attention (EA) and GMA predict simulation performance and supervisory ratings of performance. We also assess the extent to which measures of EA and GMA are associated with subgroup differences. Results indicate that, like GMA, EA positively predicts managerial simulation and supervisory ratings of performance. In addition, although reaching statistical significance in only 1 of our 4 studies, EA was generally associated with smaller subgroup differences than GMA, and meta‐analysis across our samples supports this reduced subgroup difference. Moreover, advantages of EA tend to increase as studies move from the laboratory with undergraduate students to a concurrent validation organizational setting with employees. We discuss implications for a theory‐based view of cognitive ability in employee selection and implications for managerial practice.</jats:p>",2015

Synthesizing 2 theories in the literature (the better match and social enrichment accounts), through the lens of social resources theory, I provide a conceptual and empirical breakdown of the effects of referrer quality (referrer performance at hire and referrer tenure at hire) and posthire accessibility (referrer employment and referrer–referral hire job congruence) on referral hire performance and likelihood of voluntary turnover. I tested my hypotheses with longitudinal data from 386 referrer–referral hire pairs at the same job level in a U.S. call center over a 2‐year period. Across analyses of 2 performance criteria (calls/hour and quality) and likelihood of leaving, I found a nuanced mix of benefits and liabilities that illuminate potential boundary conditions of the revised theories. Referral hires from high‐performing referrers performed better but had higher turnover propensities than those from lower performing referrers. Longer‐tenured employees also produced better performing referral hires, up to a point. Referral hires were less likely to leave, provided their referrer remained employed, but they performed less effectively under this condition. Similarly, referral hires performed worse when their job was congruent with their referrer's job. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</jats:p>",2015

We relied on 229 datasets including 633,876 productivity observations collected from approximately 625,000 individuals in occupations including research, entertainment, politics, sports, sales, and manufacturing, among others. We implemented a novel methodological approach developed in the field of physics to assess the precise shape of the productivity distribution rather than relying on a normal versus nonnormal artificial dichotomy. Results indicate that higher levels of multiplicity of productivity, monopolistic productivity, job autonomy, and job complexity (i.e., <jats:italic>conductors</jats:italic> of cumulative advantage) are associated with a higher probability of an underlying power law distribution, whereas lower productivity ceilings (i.e., <jats:italic>insulator</jats:italic> of cumulative advantage) are associated with a lower probability. In addition, higher levels of multiplicity of productivity, monopolistic productivity, and job autonomy were associated with a greater proportion of productivity stars (i.e., productivity distributions with heavier tails), whereas lower productivity ceilings were associated with a smaller proportion of productivity stars (i.e., productivity distributions with lighter tails). Results serve as a building block for future theory development and testing efforts aimed at understanding why, when, and how the distribution of individual productivity may follow a nonnormal curve—and to what extent. We also discuss implications for organizations and management in terms of the design and implementation of human resource systems (e.g., selection, training, compensation), as well as for individuals interested in becoming productivity stars themselves.</jats:p>",2015

We introduce the construct of <jats:italic>synchrony preference</jats:italic>, an individual difference that describes a willingness to adapt one's pace and rhythm within social interactions for the purpose of creating synchrony with others. We develop a measure of synchrony preference that we validate using multiple methods across 4 studies and 7 samples, which include over 1,400 individuals. In particular, we establish a nomological network and show that synchrony preference predicts flexible pacing behaviors, interpersonal facilitation, contribution to team synchrony, contribution to team performance, and job dedication.

Consistent with the perspective that targets of downward hostility are less likely to see themselves as victims when they perform acts of upward hostility, analysis of 2‐wave data from a sample of supervised employees suggested that upward hostility weakens the deleterious effects of downward hostility on subordinates’ job satisfaction, affective commitment, and psychological distress. Study 2 directly examined the presumed mechanism that underlies the effects observed in Study 1. In a 3‐wave sample, support was found for a moderated‐indirect effect framework in which the indirect effects of downward hostility on subordinates’ attitudes and psychological distress (through victim identity) were weaker when upward hostility was higher. Study 2 results also suggested that the enhancing effect of upward hostility generalizes to subjective indicators of career satisfaction and future career expectations.</jats:p>",2015
