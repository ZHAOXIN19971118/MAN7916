# Assignment 3: Manual Content Analysis

## Part 1 - Set up your Assignment 3 environment

1. Create a new folder in your `assignments/submissions` folder called `assignment_3`
2. In this folder, create the following:
   1. A new Word document called `assignment_3.docx`
   2. A new word document called `codebook.docx`
   3. A new Excel file file called `coding_form.xlsx`

## Part 2 - Codebook Development

Collect a small corpus of texts for use in this assignment. This could be news articles, job advertisements, companies' "About Us" webpage texts, or any other set of texts that you are interested in. You will need at least 10 texts if you have relatively long texts (1+ page), substantially more if you are collecting small texts (e.g., instagram posts). You will be using these texts to develop a codebook for a manual content analysis.

Choose **two** constructs that you are interested in measuring in the texts *and for which you know there will be variance in your small corpus*. For example, if you are analyzing job advertisements, you might be interested in measuring the extent to which the job advertisement emphasizes certain types of human capital as prerequisites - there is likely to be variance on that in this type of text. On the other hand, there is unlikely to be variance on references to illegal drug use in job advertisements, so that would not be a good construct to measure in this type of text for this assignment. This means before you choose constructs, it would be a good idea to read through your texts to see what types of things are mentioned in them.

**At least one of your constructs must not be as simple as extracting manifest content**. For example, if you are analyzing job advertisements, you can have one of the construct be "number of years of work experience"; however, you must have at least one construct that is significantly more complex. For example, "emphasis on innovation" is more complex and requires more coder judgment than extracting the ## from "We require ## years of relevant work experience".

Follow the procedure outlined in Neuendorf (2017) to develop a codebook (`codebook.docx`) and coding form (`coding_form.xlsx`) for your two constructs. Given you only have two constructs, your coding form is likely to be a table with the list of texts in the rows and the two constructs as columns. The James Bond example from Chapter 5 has one text (movie) per page because of how many constructs are being measured per movie - This would be a burdensome coding form for you to use with only two constructs.

In developing the codebook, you may be one of the coders, but you need to also involve one other coder (e.g., a friend, family member, fellow student, etc.) in the process. You will need to train this coder on the codebook and coding form you develop and calculate interrater reliability ([Krippendorff's alpha](https://dfreelon.org/utils/recalfront/)).

### Document contents should include:

1. In `assignment_3.docx`, briefly document:
   1. The texts you collected and constructs you selected, and why you chose them.
   2. The process you followed to develop your codebook and coding form. This section should be reasonably detailed and include:
       * The steps you followed
       * The decisions you made
       * The challenges you encountered
       * How you resolved those challenges
       * Make sure to include information about coder training and interrater reliability
   3. Briefly discuss how you would proceed if you were going to continue with the content analysis for a full sample instead of the small sample you used for this assignment.
       * What would you do differently?
       * What would you do the same?
       * Why?
2. Your codebook should be in `codebook.docx`
3. Your coding form should be in `coding_form.xlsx`

## Step 3 - Upload the assignment materials to the github server

1. Verify that the assignment_3 folder has been created and contains the two Word files, and one Excel file.
2. Commit the new folder and files to your local repository
3. Push the new folder and files to the github server
4. Check that the file is now on the github server by visiting your repository on the github website

## Step 4 - Create an 'Issue' with a 'submitted' label

1. In the Issues tab create the ***submitted*** label
2. Create a new issue called ***Assignment 2 Submission***
    * with the submitted label
    * with the commit containing your assignment linked in the body
    * assigned to me (***amckenny***)
3. That's it!
